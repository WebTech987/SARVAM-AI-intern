Project - Data Preparation to finetune LLMs

# Sarvam AI: GenAI Intern README

## Internship Overview

Welcome to the Sarvam AI GenAI Internship! This README provides an overview of the work conducted during the internship, specifically focusing on data preparation for finetuning Language Models (LLMs). The internship started in December 2023 and is currently ongoing.

## Project Highlights

### Data Preparation for LLMs

- **Data Collection:** Implemented data collection strategies using prompt engineering and Python for Text-to-Speech (TTS) models training. This involved gathering diverse datasets to enhance the model's understanding and performance.

- **Synthetic Data Generation:** Utilized synthetic data generation techniques to augment the training dataset. This approach aids in creating a more robust and varied dataset, improving the model's ability to handle different scenarios.

- **Web Scraping:** Applied web scraping techniques for data extraction, expanding the dataset by collecting relevant information from online sources. Used tools such as Scrapy and BeautifulSoup to automate the data gathering process.

### Data Validation and Cross-Correction

- **Validation Process:** Executed meticulous validation procedures using Python's pandas and NumPy. Ensured data accuracy and consistency to maintain high-quality standards for LLMs finetuning and training.

- **Cross-Correction:** Implemented cross-correction techniques to address any discrepancies in the collected data. This step is crucial to enhance the precision of the LLMs during the finetuning phase.

### Automation and Version Control

- **Git for Version Control:** Spearheaded the use of Git for version control, allowing for efficient collaboration and tracking of changes. This ensures a systematic approach to managing codebase versions throughout the project.

- **Web Scraping Automation:** Developed automation scripts for web scraping using Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, and other relevant tools. Automation streamlines the data collection process, reducing manual efforts and improving overall efficiency.

### Statistical Data Analysis

- **Python for Statistical Analysis:** Applied statistical data analysis using Python to gain insights into the characteristics of the collected data. This analysis contributes to informed decision-making during the model training and finetuning phases.

## Current Status

The internship is currently ongoing, with a focus on further enhancing the data preparation process for LLMs. Future tasks may include additional data collection, refining data augmentation strategies, and optimizing automation processes.

I know. It can be totally overwhelming. But if you're starting a travel agency
from home, these steps will help prepare you to feel 10,000% no those extra
zeros are NOT typos! more confident. What are the preliminary steps you need
to take when starting a travel agency? Funny you should ask . . .

 **Here are the steps to take to start your travel agency from home:**

###  

##  **1\. Find a Travel Agency Niche**

A niche is your friend. When you start your home-based travel agency, a niche
will help you establish your brand, create your travel agency name, and
navigate the world of consortia when you get to that point. Starting a travel
agency without a niche is like traveling without a compass or, let's be
honest, a smartphone. Are you going to be focusing on a destination? Maybe
you'll be like Andres Zuleta, who specializes in Japan tours:

Or maybe you'll focus on a type of travel, like Deb Fogarty, who specializes
in cruising:

Or maybe you're like Will Medina and have a love for destination weddings and
honeymoons:

Or maybe you're more attracted to the corporate world and aim to book travel
for corporations like Karen Hurlbut:

Whatever your niche, it's the first problem to solve when you're starting your
travel agency! We have a free brainstorming **exercise to help you find
niches** that you're
passionate about.

Read up on how to develop your niche
here!

###  

##  **2\. Choose Your Travel Agency's Name**

> Vendors will need a travel agency name for their records so have one ready
> before you can start selling travel.

Whether you go with a host agency or choose to go independent, you're going to
need a name for our agency. **The vendors hotels, cruise lines, airlines,
etc will need a travel agency name for their records so have one ready before
you can start selling travel.** Having a niche already picked out can help you
as you **decide on your travel agency's
name**.

Starting your travel agency from home or otherwise is a lot of work. The
last thing you want as your travel agency opens its doors is a letter saying
you've infringed on someone else's trademark! We help you through the things
you need to consider when choosing a name for your agency. Are their any
competitor's with similar names that will make it harder for you to pull up at
the top of the search engines? Are the URLs available? Are their any
copyrights? We go through this and a whole lot more, so dig in!

Here's the things to consider when choosing your travel agency's
name!

###  

##  **3\. Choose a Travel Agency Business Structure**

> You can change your business structure as your needs evolve.

A base step in starting your travel agency from home is deciding on a business
structure. There's a lot that goes into what is the best fit for you. Do you
have personal assets like a house or car that you want to make sure are
protected? How much money do you want to spend?

We help you **understand the different business structure options for your
new travel agency** **:** Sole proprietor, partnership, LLC, S Corp.

As you're starting your travel agency, you may feel like the low cost of a
sole proprietor makes the most sense for you. **It's important to know that
you can change your business structure as your needs evolve.**

As your business grows and you're making more bookings which exposes you to
more liability, you can always move to a structure that gives you more
personal liability protection, like the LLC. While it's more expensive, and
may not be feasible for everyone as they're starting their travel agency, the
protection it offers to your personal assets is incredibly important as your
business grows.

How do you decide on a business structure? We'll walk you through it
here.

###  

##  **4\. Create Your Travel Agency Business Plan**

Next step in starting your travel agency? A business plan!

While a travel agency business plan isn't technically required, it is
something I highly recommend. I didn't write a business plan when I started
this site but I also knew online marketing and the travel industry front and
back and had the industry connections to make it work. Most people starting a
travel agency from home either don't have experience in starting a company or
they don't have experience in travel. This is where a business plan can help.

 **What a business plan does for you is it forces you to think through each
different area of your business and come up with a plan.** Will you stick to
that plan 100%? Probably not. But it gives you something to refer back to and
helps you organize your thoughts. Plan to take a chunk of time to work on it
as it's not something you want to do willy-nilly.

Not only that, but we made it really easy with our free **15-page travel
agency business plan**! All you need to do is download our template and adapt
it to your agency.

###  

While I didn't write a business plan for Host Agency Reviews, I did write a
VERY detailed travel agency business plan for you. :) It's completely filled
out with a fictitious travel agency. That's helpful because you can use some
of the data and ideas in there on your travel agency's business plan.

 **Here's a peek of the business plan. Just to note, this version is not
editable!** If you want a copy of the business plan, please fill out this
form and we'll drop it in an email!

###  

That was good stuff, right? So letâ€™s get started on the business plan for your
travel agency. **Weâ€™ll start by having you** **download the travel agency
business plan
template** **an editable version of the one you just
looked at above.**

###  

##  **5\. Register Your Travel Agency with the State**

You're doing great! Starting a travel agency from home isn't as tough as you
thought, is it? When you have a road map, it's easier much easier to navigate
the start-up process.

Ok, now that you've nailed down your niche, come up with your name, and
settled on a business structure, the next step is letting the state government
know you've got a company. The Small Business Administration SBA website
shows ** ** **how to register your company's name by
state**. If you are an LLC, the SBA also has a **state-by-state guide
on how to register your LLC**.

###  

> A word of warning: When doing a DBS, your businesses, even though they have
> different names are still legally considered the same entity.

###  

 **Registering your company with the state is an important step because you
will need this proof to open a business bank account** and other random things
running FB business ads, getting a loan as your business grows. Do yourself
a favor and when those certificates come in, keep them handy in a file for
your company's legal documents.

When you start your travel agency, you may have registered it as Margarita
Travel. But over time, that might change. Let's say you fell into becoming the
local destination wedding expert that everyone turned to. Margarita Travel
works, but you want to have a more romantic name for those clients and
different branding. So you create a new brand, Beach Romance, that specializes
in destination weddings. Do you need to let the state know about this new
company, even though it's really your same company? Yuppers.

You'll need to file a DBA with the state. DBA is an acronym for "Doing
Business As." It's also sometimes referred to as a fictitious name, trade
name, or assumed name. **Your DBA is essentially saying, 'My formal company is
Margarita Travel, but I also go by Beach Romance.'**

To help you get a feel for the pros/cons of a dual-brand, listen to Andrey
Zakahrenko's story of how his agency evolved into two brands: _This was our
first ever podcast so please forgive the horrible sound quality!_

The one thing to know about DBAs is that they don't create a separate entity,
it allows you to legally operate under different names. A word of warning:
When doing a DBS, your businesses, even though they have different names are
still legally considered the same entity. That means if someone sues Beach
Romance for a honeymoon gone wrong, Margarita Travel is also being sued since
it's the same company.

###  

##  **6\. Get an FEIN** **Optional, but Recommended**

A Federal Employer Identification Number FEIN is like a social security
number for your company. It's a number to identify your business. Technically,
you do not need an FEIN if you're a sole proprietor or a single-member LLC
with no employees since you can use your social security number to file taxes.

However, I personally prefer not to give out my social security number if I
don't have to. I also like to get my pencils lined up from the get-go.
**It's** **free to get an FEIN** **, takes just a few minutes
and, if you move to a business structure that requires an FEIN, you won't have
to worry about changing out your SS# for an FEIN on legal documents or other
places that require a business identification number.**

In general, I would recommend getting an EIN when starting a travel agency.
Also, make sure to check in with your tax professional when it's tax filing
timeâ€”for certain business structures, you may still file under your SS# even
though you have an FEIN. Confusing, I know. That's why you go to the
professionals! 

###  

##  **7\. Set Up Your Travel Agency Financials**  

Like the FEIN, when starting a travel agency, you don't _need_ a separate
business bank account or credit card if you're a sole proprietor, but you'll
have wished you'd had set one up come tax time! **Separating your personal
bank account from the business account  from the start makes accounting easier
and will help you keep track of business expense write-offs. **

Wondering **what travel expenses you can write off as a travel
advisor**? We've got a
resource for that too.

Important to note: If you choose a business structure that offers personal
liability protection, like an LLC, you _need_ to keep your business and
personal money separate. If you are mixing finances and paying personal bills
out of your business account, or vice versa, that opens you up to personal
liability.

The argument is that, yes, when you started your travel agency you chose an
LLC structure, which protects your personal assets. BUT, clearly, the business
and the owner are not separate entities because the owner is making business
payments out of their personal bank account or vice versa. And if you're one
and the same, then your personal assets are also the business's assets.

There's a lot to consider when it comes to travel agency financials and
getting the foundations laid. Don't worry, **we walk you through all things
having to do with your travel agency's
financials**: what to consider when choosing your bank, the documents you need
to have ready for the bank, what business credit cards are best, and the most
common software travel agencies use for their bookkeeping, and how to find a
bookkeeper for your agency.

## 8\. Decide if a Host Agency Is for Your Travel Agency

We mentioned host agencies at the very beginning of the article. And maybe you
noticed the name of our site. **We're big fans of host agencies for people
starting a travel agency** . . .but it's not for every agency out there.

Your next step is going to be one of the hardest and takes a lot of research.
You need to decide if you want to go with a host agency, franchise, or go
independent.

How do you know if you should go with a **host
agency,** **travel
agency franchise**, or if you should be independent and **get your own
accreditation**? How do you decide which **travel
consortia** to join if you are independent? How do you choose a host agency
when there are **100+ listed on the
site**?

Don't you worry, little bird, it's easy to feel overwhelmed, but we have
answers to all these questions.

To start, check out our article, " **The Top 10 Benefits of Using a Host
Agency** **.** " If you read that and decide a host agency is a good fit for
you, you'll move on to our article on **choosing a host
agency** and take a look at our **best host agencies of
2023**.

Oh, and we've got a great tool for you to help narrow down your list of host
agencies and/or travel franchises. Here's a free nifty spreadsheet to help
you narrow down your top picks! ðŸ˜Š Pssst, if you don't see the download below,

## **9\. Read our Home-Based Travel Agent Resources Page**  

I put together a page with loads of links so you don't have to scour the web.

Resources** page. ðŸ˜Š

 **Not only that, connecting with host agencies, travel franchises and
consortia couldn't be easier!** You can go directly to their profile to write
them via Host Agency Reviews' Q&A feature. The beauty of this is that tons of
agents will also get to learn from your question too!

!How to ask a host agency a question

 **Did I mention that EVERY question you ask enters you into** **our monthly
giveaway** **?** Yup. Ask
away!

PS: Since you've stuck around so long . . . here's a special hint. We don't
get _that_ many entries so it's definitely worth your time to ask those
questions!

Just starting to narrow down hosts? Start by asking them each the same

## Starting a Travel Agency from Home: What to Expect Time-Wise

 **In general, it will take a few years to get your agency off the ground.
**This is the case with any entrepreneurial endeavor. We've found that it can
take 3-4 years to really start generating a sustainable income.

Here's the reason it can take a while to get going especially when you're
starting a travel agency from home

  1. It takes a while to build a client base and develop your brand
  2. Even when you do make your first bookings, you're not paid **commission** until after your client completes their travel or after final payment for some vendors. So, if you make seven bookings in January but the clients aren't traveling until November, you can see how your first-year money might be tight. Let's just say, if you're wanting to walk off your current job, and are thinking that the big bucks will roll in the next month, you might want to reconsider your strategy. ðŸ˜‰
  3. Travel is something most people only do 1-2 times a year. Even with referrals and repeat clients, it can take a lot longer to build a steady business compared to a new restaurant or other service industries. 

###  

## Starting a Travel Agency from Home: What to Expect Money-Wise

And money. You probably want to know what you can expect when it comes to
money, huh?! ðŸ˜ŠI hate to admit it but there is no one set answer. It depends on
soooo many factors. The good news is that we were so curious to answer this
question that we asked a few hundred new travel agents about their income in
the first years of starting a travel agency.

 **It just so happens we have some hard** **data on travel agent income and
start up costs** **in first 5 years of business!**

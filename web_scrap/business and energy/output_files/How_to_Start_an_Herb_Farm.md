In 2016, for the first time, Americans spent more money eating out than on
groceries. During the same year, we paid more than a staggering 110 billion
dollars for food in this country. Whether we are cooking at home or going out
to eat, it is clear we love to eat and we are willing to pay for it.
Entrepreneurs who are interested in farming can earn a good living by
supplying fresh culinary herbs to restaurants, retail stores, and directly to
consumers.

### STEP 1: Plan your business

A clear plan is essential for success as an entrepreneur. It will help you map
out the specifics of your business and discover some unknowns. A few important
topics to consider are:

  * What will you name your business?
  * What are the startup and ongoing costs?
  * Who is your target market?
  * How much can you charge customers?

Luckily we have done a lot of this research for you.

#### What will you name your business?

Choosing the right name is important and challenging. If you don't already
have a name in mind, visit our How to Name a Business guide or get help brainstorming a name with our Herb Farm Name
Generator

If you operate a sole proprietorship, you
might want to operate under a business name other than your own name. Visit
our DBA guide to learn more.

When registering a business name, we
recommend researching your business name by checking:

  * Your state's business records
  * Federal and state trademark records
  * Social media platforms
  * Web domain availability.

It's very important to secure your domain name before someone else does.

#### What are the costs involved in opening an herb farm?

Another great reason to start an herb farm as a new business is that there is
such a low economic barrier. Some herb farmers purchase a large plot of land
and build greenhouses to extend their growing season, but it is not necessary.
A few hundred dollars is all it takes to buy the tools and seeds to start
small an herb farm. But for those who want to earn a full-time income from
herb farming, the startup expenses are a little higher.

Potential herb farmers who already own a piece of land can avoid the biggest
expense, land. For those who do not have a place to plant, it is almost always
cheaper to rent than to purchase land. Many commercial landowners have vacant
land and may rent it for a very low price. Herb farmers who are interested in
having their products certified organic need to be a little more choosy when
finding a place to plant.

After finding land, the next largest expense is purchasing supplies.
Thankfully, very little in the way of equipment is necessary to grow herbs on
a small scale successfully. A few hand tools, containers and perhaps a
greenhouse or poly tunnel to extend the growing season. Herb farmers who do
not have access to quality soil on their land, should invest in high-end
potting soil, compost and fertilizer.

A few hundred dollars can buy all the seeds and cuttings for an entire growing
season. Heirloom seeds often cost less than popular hybrid varieties, but they
can take more time and care to grow. However, many people swear by the
superior quality and taste of heirloom herbs and vegetables.

It is possible to start a profitable small-scale herb farm which doesn't
require purchasing or renting land for less than $2,000.

#### What are the ongoing expenses for an herb farm?

Ongoing expenses are all the consumables like seeds, fertilizer, potting soil,
containers, compost, and utilities. Herb farms need to pay the cost for the
land and labor every month, in addition to any packaging and transportation
costs that may be involved.

#### Who is the target market?

There are three types of customers for herbs: restaurants, retailers, and
consumers. Selling directly to consumers is the most profitable, but also
provides the least steady income. Retailers typically offer the lowest per
pound price, but are often willing to buy out an entire harvest. Restaurants
usually offer a better price than a retailer, but less than a consumer.

#### How does an herb farm make money?

Herb farms make money by selling culinary herbs to wholesalers, restaurants,
and consumers.

#### How much can you charge customers?

The prices consumers are willing to pay depend on the location and the type of
herb. Certain herbs do typically bring in more profit than others, such as
basil, catnip, lavender, chives, and cilantro.

#### How much profit can an herb farm make?

It is well within the reach of a herb farmer to earn over $30,000 per acre of
land each year by choosing high-priced and popular herbs.

#### How can you make your business more profitable?

Owners of herb farms can greatly improve their profits by creating value-added
products from their herbs. Dried herb pillows, herbal teas, soaps, and candles
are all high profit items which are easy to make and sell well. Herb farms who
are able to get certified as organic can charge more for every product they
sell.

Some herb farms make extra money by hosting events such as weddings or
vacations. However, this type of side business would require that your land be
suitable as an event venue, and you would also need to have a small team to
handle bookings, set-up, and other aspects of hosting parties.

### STEP 2: Form a legal entity

The most common business structure types are
the sole proprietorship,
partnership, limited liability company
LLC, and corporation.

Establishing a legal business entity such as an **LLC** or **corporation**
protects you from being held personally liable if your herb farm is sued.

You can form an LLC yourself and
pay only the minimal state LLC costs or hire one of
the Best LLC Services for a small, additional fee.

**Recommended:** You will need to elect a registered agent for your LLC. LLC formation packages usually include a free year of
registered agent services. You can
choose to hire a registered agent or act as your own.

### STEP 3: Register for taxes

You will need to register for a variety of state and federal taxes before you
can open for business.

In order to register for taxes you will need to apply for an EIN. It's really
easy and free!

You can acquire your EIN through the IRS
website. If you would like to learn more about EINs, read our
article, What is an EIN?

There are specific state taxes that might apply to your business. Learn more
about state sales tax and franchise taxes in our
state sales tax guides.

### STEP 4: Open a business bank account & credit card

Using dedicated business banking and credit accounts is essential for personal
asset protection.

When your personal and business accounts are mixed, your personal assets your
home, car, and other valuables are at risk in the event your business is
sued. In business law, this is referred to as piercing your corporate
veil.

#### Open a business bank account

Besides being a requirement when applying for business loans, opening a
business bank account:

  * Separates your personal assets from your company's assets, which is necessary for personal asset protection.
  * Makes accounting and tax filing easier.

**Recommended:** Read our Best Banks for Small Business review to find the best national bank or credit union.

#### Get a business credit card

Getting a business credit card helps you:

  * Separate personal and business expenses by putting your business' expenses all in one place.
  * Build your company's credit history, which can be useful to raise money later on.

**Recommended:** Apply for an easy approval business credit card from BILL and build your business credit quickly.

### STEP 5: Set up business accounting

Recording your various expenses and sources of income is critical to
understanding the financial performance of your business. Keeping accurate and
detailed accounts also greatly simplifies your annual tax filing.

### STEP 6: Obtain necessary permits and licenses

Failure to acquire necessary permits and licenses can result in hefty fines,
or even cause your business to be shut down.

#### Federal Business Licensing Requirements

There are federal regulations regarding what can and cannot be added to, sold
as, and processed with food. Attached is a resource from the Food and Drug
Administration detailing the process of starting a food business: How to
Start a Food Business

#### State & Local Business Licensing Requirements

Certain state permits and licenses may be needed to operate an herb farm
business. Learn more about licensing requirements in your state by visiting
SBA's reference to state licenses and permits.

**Most businesses are required to collect sales tax on the goods or services
they provide.** To learn more about how sales tax will affect your business,
read our article, Sales Tax for Small Businesses.

### STEP 7: Get business insurance

Just as with licenses and permits, your business needs insurance in order to
operate safely and lawfully. **Business Insurance protects your company’s financial wellbeing in the event
of a covered loss.**

There are several types of insurance policies created for different types of
businesses with different risks. If you’re unsure of the types of risks that
your business may face, **begin withGeneral Liability Insurance**. This is the most common
coverage that small businesses need, so it’s a great place to start for your
business.

Another notable insurance policy that many businesses need is Workers’
Compensation Insurance. If your business will have employees, it’s a good chance that
your state will require you to carry Workers' Compensation Coverage.


 ### STEP 8: Define your brand

 Your brand is what your company stands for, as well as how your business is
perceived by the public. A strong brand will help your business stand out from
competitors.

 #### How to promote & market an herb farm



 Herb farmers may want to focus their marketing campaigns on the health and
ecological benefits of locally grown herbs.



 #### How to keep customers coming back



 While many customers may purchase herbs once because they are a local
product, if the herbs aren't fresh and delicious, no one will want to buy them
again. Herb farmers need to ensure they never sell any herbs which don't look
or taste great.



 ### STEP 9: Create your business website



 After defining your brand and creating your logo the next step is to create
a website for your business.



 While creating a website is an essential step, some may fear that it’s out of
their reach because they don’t have any website-building experience. While
this may have been a reasonable fear back in 2015, web technology has seen
huge advancements in the past few years that makes the lives of small business
owners much simpler.



 Here are the main reasons why you shouldn’t delay building your website:



   * **All legitimate businesses have websites** \- full stop. The size or industry of your business does not matter when it comes to getting your business online.
   * Social media accounts like **Facebook pages or LinkedIn business profiles are not a replacement for a business website** that you own.
   * Website builder tools like the GoDaddy Website Builder have made creating a basic website extremely simple. **You don’t need to hire a web developer** or designer to create a website that you can be proud of.




 ### STEP 10: Set up your business phone system



 Getting a phone set up for your business is one of the best ways to help keep
your personal life and business life separate and private. That’s not the only
benefit; it also helps you make your business more automated, gives your
business legitimacy, and makes it easier for potential customers to find and
contact you.

### STEP 1: Plan your business

A clear plan is essential for success as an entrepreneur. It will help you map
out the specifics of your business and discover some unknowns. A few important
topics to consider are:

  * What will you name your business?
  * What are the startup and ongoing costs?
  * Who is your target market?
  * How much can you charge customers?

Luckily we have done a lot of this research for you.

#### What will you name your business?

Choosing the right name is important and challenging. If you don't already
have a name in mind, visit our How to Name a Business guide or get help brainstorming a name with our Mushroom Farm Name
Generator

If you operate a sole proprietorship, you
might want to operate under a business name other than your own name. Visit
our DBA guide to learn more.

When registering a business name, we
recommend researching your business name by checking:

  * Your state's business records
  * Federal and state trademark records
  * Social media platforms
  * Web domain availability.

It's very important to secure your domain name before someone else does.

#### What are the costs involved in opening a mushroom farm?

The startup expenses for a mushroom farm are minimal.

Business owners need a space for growing mushrooms. This doesn't need to be a
large space -- 500 square feet is big enough to grow 12,000 pounds of
mushrooms a year, according to Profitable
Plants. Business owners should be able to
control the temperature, humidity, and light in the space, though.

Many business owners already have a space in their home that meets these
requirements. Those that don't might only have to purchase a space heater,
humidifier, or dehumidifier.

The other main upfront costs are buying growing medium and spores, but these
are both inexpensive. Straw, cardboard used coffee grounds and many other
cheap materials can serve as growing mediums. Mushroom spores can be purchased
for just a few dollars. Spore Trading
Post sells 100 plugs of spores for
$18.95.

#### What are the ongoing expenses for a mushroom farm?

The ongoing expenses for a mushroom farm business are minimal. They include
new growing material, additional spores, and utility costs.

#### Who is the target market?

A mushroom farm business' ideal customer is a restaurant that focuses on using
locally sourced ingredients. A restaurant will have regular orders that
provide stable income. A restaurant that focuses on serving locally sourced
foods will be less likely to purchase their mushrooms from a large supplier
that's in another state.

#### How does a mushroom farm make money?

A mushroom farm makes money by selling harvested mushrooms. Mushrooms might be
sold by the pint, quart, or pound.

#### How much can you charge customers?

Specialty mushrooms typically retail for $16 per pound. Oyster mushrooms
wholesale for between $6 and $8 per pound, and other types of specialty
mushrooms have similar wholesale prices.

Because most people don't want to spend $16 on mushrooms, retail sales are
usually done by the pint or quarter-pound. Wholesale transactions normally are
by the pound.

#### How much profit can a mushroom farm make?

A mushroom farm business that grows 12,000 pounds of mushrooms and only sells
to wholesale clients could make between $72,000 and $96,000 annually. Selling
retail in addition to wholesale would significantly increase the business'
revenue. Since the ongoing expenses are minimal, most of this revenue would be
profit.

#### How can you make your business more profitable?

Many mushroom farm businesses add a revenue stream by assembling grow-your-own
mushroom kits. These may be in cardboard boxes, logs or some other medium.
Offering classes on growing or using mushrooms is another way to increase
revenue and profits.

### STEP 2: Form a legal entity

The most common business structure types are
the sole proprietorship,
partnership, limited liability company
LLC, and corporation.

Establishing a legal business entity such as an **LLC** or **corporation**
protects you from being held personally liable if your mushroom farm is sued.


You can form an LLC yourself and
pay only the minimal state LLC costs or hire one of
the Best LLC Services for a small, additional fee.

**Recommended:** You will need to elect a registered agent for your LLC. LLC formation packages usually include a free year of
registered agent services. You can
choose to hire a registered agent or act as your own.

### STEP 3: Register for taxes

You will need to register for a variety of state and federal taxes before you
can open for business.

In order to register for taxes you will need to apply for an EIN. It's really
easy and free!

You can acquire your EIN through the IRS
website. If you would like to learn more about EINs, read our
article, What is an EIN?

There are specific state taxes that might apply to your business. Learn more
about state sales tax and franchise taxes in our
state sales tax guides.

### STEP 4: Open a business bank account & credit card

Using dedicated business banking and credit accounts is essential for personal
asset protection.

When your personal and business accounts are mixed, your personal assets your
home, car, and other valuables are at risk in the event your business is
sued. In business law, this is referred to as piercing your corporate
veil.

#### Open a business bank account

Besides being a requirement when applying for business loans, opening a
business bank account:

  * Separates your personal assets from your company's assets, which is necessary for personal asset protection.
  * Makes accounting and tax filing easier.

**Recommended:** Read our Best Banks for Small Business review to find the best national bank or credit union.

#### Get a business credit card

Getting a business credit card helps you:

  * Separate personal and business expenses by putting your business' expenses all in one place.
  * Build your company's credit history, which can be useful to raise money later on.

**Recommended:** Apply for an easy approval business credit card from BILL and build your business credit quickly.

### STEP 5: Set up business accounting

Recording your various expenses and sources of income is critical to
understanding the financial performance of your business. Keeping accurate and
detailed accounts also greatly simplifies your annual tax filing.

### STEP 6: Obtain necessary permits and licenses

Failure to acquire necessary permits and licenses can result in hefty fines,
or even cause your business to be shut down.

#### State & Local Business Licensing Requirements

  * Certain state permits and licenses may be needed to operate a mushroom farm. Learn more about licensing requirements in your state by visiting SBA's reference to state licenses and permits.

**Most businesses are required to collect sales tax on the goods or services
they provide.** To learn more about how sales tax will affect your business,
read our article, Sales Tax for Small Businesses.

#### Services Contract

In business where services are provided on an extended basis, a services
contract is often put in place outlining terms and conditions of service.

Mushroom farming businesses should require clients to sign a services
agreement before starting a new project.  This agreement should clarify client
expectations and minimize risk of legal disputes by setting out payment terms
and conditions, and service level expectations. An example of a service
contract can be found here.

#### Labor safety requirements

It is important to comply with all Occupational Safety and Health
Administration requirements.

Relevant requirements include:

  * Employee injury report
  * Safety signage
  * Etc.

### STEP 7: Get business insurance

Just as with licenses and permits, your business needs insurance in order to
operate safely and lawfully. **Business Insurance protects your company’s financial wellbeing in the event
of a covered loss.**

There are several types of insurance policies created for different types of
businesses with different risks. If you’re unsure of the types of risks that
your business may face, **begin withGeneral Liability Insurance**. This is the most common
coverage that small businesses need, so it’s a great place to start for your
business.

Another notable insurance policy that many businesses need is Workers’
Compensation Insurance. If your business will have employees, it’s a good chance that
your state will require you to carry Workers' Compensation Coverage.

 ### STEP 8: Define your brand



 Your brand is what your company stands for, as well as how your business is
perceived by the public. A strong brand will help your business stand out from
competitors.

awareness for your new website.



 #### How to promote & market a mushroom farm



 One of the most effective ways to promote a mushroom farm business is through
in-person interactions. Talking to potential customers, whether they're
consumers, grocery store owners, or chefs, is the best way for business owners
to educate customers and share their passion for mushrooms. Business owners
can create opportunities to connect with potential customers by selling
mushrooms at farmers' markets and making sales calls to businesses.



 #### How to keep customers coming back



 Mushroom farm businesses can keep customers coming back for more mushrooms by
helping them discover more ways to use mushrooms. This may include sharing
recipes or introducing mushrooms as a healthy snack. The more customers use
mushrooms, the more frequently they'll need to purchase the fungi.



 ### STEP 9: Create your business website



 After defining your brand and creating your logo the next step is to create
a website for your business.



 While creating a website is an essential step, some may fear that it’s out of
their reach because they don’t have any website-building experience. While
this may have been a reasonable fear back in 2015, web technology has seen
huge advancements in the past few years that makes the lives of small business
owners much simpler.



 Here are the main reasons why you shouldn’t delay building your website:



   * **All legitimate businesses have websites** \- full stop. The size or industry of your business does not matter when it comes to getting your business online.
   * Social media accounts like **Facebook pages or LinkedIn business profiles are not a replacement for a business website** that you own.
   * Website builder tools like the GoDaddy Website Builder have made creating a basic website extremely simple. **You don’t need to hire a web developer** or designer to create a website that you can be proud of.




 **Recommended** : Get started today using our recommended website
builder or check out our review of the Best Website
Builders.



 Other popular website builders are: WordPress, WIX, Weebly, Squarespace, and
Shopify.



 ### STEP 10: Set up your business phone system



 Getting a phone set up for your business is one of the best ways to help keep
your personal life and business life separate and private. That’s not the only
benefit; it also helps you make your business more automated, gives your
business legitimacy, and makes it easier for potential customers to find and
contact you.



 There are many services available to entrepreneurs who want to set up a
business phone system. We’ve reviewed the top companies and rated them based
on price, features, and ease of use. Check out our review of the Best
Business Phone Systems 2023 to find the best phone service for your small business.



 ## Is this Business Right For You?



 Anyone who enjoys working with their hands and interacting with people may be
well-suited for running a mushroom farm business. Growing mushrooms is a
hands-on task, and having an ability to connect with people can help business
owners share their product with potential customers.



 A mushroom farm can be started as a part-time business while working another
job. Mushrooms require a little attention each day, but they aren't too
demanding, and they can be tended to at any time of the day or night. It's
easy to fit growing mushrooms around other obligations.





 ### What happens during a typical day at a mushroom farm?



 The process of actually growing mushrooms involves three steps:



   * preparing growing medium, which takes a few hours and should be done once per week
   * misting growing mushrooms, which takes a few minutes and must be done daily
   * harvesting mature mushrooms, which takes a few minutes and should be done every day or two




 In addition to these tasks, mushroom farm business owners also must find
customers, package harvested mushrooms, and deliver mushrooms.



 ### What are some skills and experiences that will help you build a
successful mushroom farm?



 In order to run a mushroom farm, business owners must know how to grow
mushrooms. Many companies offer courses and seminars on growing these fungi.
For instance, Fungi for the People offers a week-long course
every few months, and Radical Mycology has courses in many different states.
Additionally, both Mushroom
Mountain and The Mushroom Growers'
Newsletter maintain lists of upcoming conferences and educational events.



 Business owners may also want to consult the American Mushroom
Institute or the North American Mycological
Association. Both organizations have lists of
online materials that cover mycology.



 Finally, many books about growing mushrooms and starting a mushroom business
are available. A few titles include  Organic Mushroom Farming and
Mycoremediation,  Growing Mushrooms for
Profit and  Starting a Mushroom Growing Business on a
Shoestring. Some of these books provide valuable
insights into growing mushrooms commercially, while others are helpful
resources that can be consulted after a class is over.



 ### What is the growth potential for a mushroom farm?



 A mushroom farm business may be a small, one-person operation, or it might
grow into a large company that has multiple locations. Detroit Mushroom
Factory,
which is run by just two people, is an example of a small mushroom farm.
Ostrom's is a much larger company that
has customers located throughout the Northwest United States.


 ### Find a business mentor



 One of the greatest resources an entrepreneur can have is quality mentorship.
As you start planning your business, connect with a free business
resource near you to get the help you need.



 Having a support network in place to turn to during tough times is a major
factor of success for new business owners.

### STEP 1: Plan your business

A clear plan is essential for success as an entrepreneur. It will help you map
out the specifics of your business and discover some unknowns. A few important
topics to consider are:

  * What will you name your business?
  * What are the startup and ongoing costs?
  * Who is your target market?
  * How much can you charge customers?

Luckily we have done a lot of this research for you.

#### What will you name your business?

Choosing the right name is important and challenging. If you don't already
have a name in mind, visit our How to Name a Business guide or get help brainstorming a name with our Online Dating
Consulting Business Name Generator

If you operate a sole proprietorship, you
might want to operate under a business name other than your own name. Visit
our DBA guide to learn more.

When registering a business name, we
recommend researching your business name by checking:

  * Your state's business records
  * Federal and state trademark records
  * Social media platforms
  * Web domain availability.

It's very important to secure your domain name before someone else does.

#### What are the costs involved in opening an online dating consulting
business?

Costs can be relatively low to start. You likely won't need any other supplies
besides a computer. You can have an office, but it works just as well to meet
your clients in a public location like a coffee shop. A website can be started
on a service like Squarespace for just $150 a year, and social media platforms
are entirely free. You may want to invest any of your start-up costs with paid
advertising on social media to help get the word out though. Facebook pay-per-
click ads can be expensive, depending on your area and competition.

#### What are the ongoing expenses for an online dating consulting business?

Dating consultants will have the following ongoing expenses:

  * Website maintenance
  * General supplies paper, pens, smartphones, laptop
  * Advertising costs

#### Who is the target market?

Dating consultants choose their own target market. Typically, the ideal person
is a busy professional who may not understand the rules or tricks behind
creating a dating profile. Most consultants then choose a specific niche that
accounts for the area they serve. For example, a young person in Denver may be
more likely to want a spouse and children, while an older person in NYC may
just be looking for companionship. However, if you feel strongly toward one
demographic or another, you can likely carve out a client base regardless of
where you are with the help of your expertise and passion.

#### How does an online dating consulting business make money?

Online dating consultants will generally charge for their time. A professional
company as opposed to an independent consultant may charge by the week for
access to their full team. More often though, consultants will charge a
package rate that includes a specific level of service for a designated amount
of time.

#### How much can you charge customers?

Costs vary depending on the service you offer. A quick profile revamp may cost
as little as $50, while a full-scale service can charge up to $2,000 a week
for VIPs. A consultant should determine how much they want to make an hour,
and then determine how long it takes for her to service an average client.
They should also check what similar services are charging in their area to
avoid pricing themselves out of the market.

#### How much profit can an online dating consulting business make?

Profits can be considerable. Depending on how much you spend on advertising,
you could potentially be making close to 95% profit on your services or even
more.

#### How can you make your business more profitable?

Dating consultants may want to offer classes about online dating to attract
more people at a lower rate. They may also consider doing group sessions where
people can vent about their experiences and get advice about how to make
online dating go more smoothly.

### STEP 2: Form a legal entity

The most common business structure types are
the sole proprietorship,
partnership, limited liability company
LLC, and corporation.

Establishing a legal business entity such as an **LLC** or **corporation**
protects you from being held personally liable if your online dating
consulting business is sued.
You can form an LLC yourself and
pay only the minimal state LLC costs or hire one of
the Best LLC Services for a small, additional fee.

**Recommended:** You will need to elect a registered agent for your LLC. LLC formation packages usually include a free year of
registered agent services. You can
choose to hire a registered agent or act as your own.

### STEP 3: Register for taxes

You will need to register for a variety of state and federal taxes before you
can open for business.

In order to register for taxes you will need to apply for an EIN. It's really
easy and free!

You can acquire your EIN through the IRS
website. If you would like to learn more about EINs, read our
article, What is an EIN?

There are specific state taxes that might apply to your business. Learn more
about state sales tax and franchise taxes in our
state sales tax guides.

### STEP 4: Open a business bank account & credit card

Using dedicated business banking and credit accounts is essential for personal
asset protection.

When your personal and business accounts are mixed, your personal assets your
home, car, and other valuables are at risk in the event your business is
sued. In business law, this is referred to as piercing your corporate
veil.

#### Open a business bank account

Besides being a requirement when applying for business loans, opening a
business bank account:

  * Separates your personal assets from your company's assets, which is necessary for personal asset protection.
  * Makes accounting and tax filing easier.

**Recommended:** Read our Best Banks for Small Business review to find the best national bank or credit union.

#### Get a business credit card

Getting a business credit card helps you:

  * Separate personal and business expenses by putting your business' expenses all in one place.
  * Build your company's credit history, which can be useful to raise money later on.

**Recommended:** Apply for an easy approval business credit card from BILL and build your business credit quickly.

### STEP 5: Set up business accounting

Recording your various expenses and sources of income is critical to
understanding the financial performance of your business. Keeping accurate and
detailed accounts also greatly simplifies your annual tax filing.

### STEP 6: Obtain necessary permits and licenses

Failure to acquire necessary permits and licenses can result in hefty fines,
or even cause your business to be shut down.

#### State & Local Business Licensing Requirements

Certain state permits and licenses may be needed to operate a online dating
consulting business. Learn more about licensing requirements in your state by
visiting SBA's reference to state licenses and
permits.

**Most businesses are required to collect sales tax on the goods or services
they provide.** To learn more about how sales tax will affect your business,
read our article, Sales Tax for Small Businesses.

#### Services Contract

Online dating consulting businesses should require clients to sign a services
agreement before starting a new project. This agreement should clarify client
expectations and minimize risk of legal disputes by setting out payment terms
and conditions, service level expectations, and intellectual property
ownership.

#### Informed Consent Agreement

It is recommended to provide clients with informed consent agreements to
decrease legal liability and encourage transparency.

### STEP 7: Get business insurance

Just as with licenses and permits, your business needs insurance in order to
operate safely and lawfully. **Business Insurance protects your companyâ€™s financial wellbeing in the event
of a covered loss.**

There are several types of insurance policies created for different types of
businesses with different risks. If youâ€™re unsure of the types of risks that
your business may face, **begin withGeneral Liability Insurance**. This is the most common
coverage that small businesses need, so itâ€™s a great place to start for your
business.

Another notable insurance policy that many businesses need is Workersâ€™
Compensation Insurance. If your business will have employees, itâ€™s a good chance that
your state will require you to carry Workers' Compensation Coverage.

 ### STEP 8: Define your brand



 Your brand is what your company stands for, as well as how your business is
perceived by the public. A strong brand will help your business stand out from
competitors.


 **Recommended** : Get a logo using Truic's free logo Generator
no email or sign up required, or use a Premium Logo
Maker.



 If you already have a logo, you can also add it to a QR code with our
Free QR Code Generator. Choose from 13 QR code types to
create a code for your business cards and publications, or to help spread
awareness for your new website.



 #### How to promote & market an online dating consulting business



 Brag about your stats! This is the best way to let people know that you get
results. Even if you're just starting off, let people know your personal
numbers. If you had 75% of potential partners to respond to your first email,
then that's a truly incredible stat that others will want to know about. If
you've successfully played matchmaker in the past, talk about how many of the
couples are still together. Start conversations with people on a social media
page by asking specific questions about the dating culture e.g., what's your
favorite dating platform and why?. If your target demographic is on the
younger side, then pay-per-click advertising on social media may bring a
considerable ROI.



 #### How to keep customers coming back



 The best thing a dating consultant can do is hope for recommendations from
their customers. Being personal and professional will help, but dating
consultants should also go the extra mile. It's like a concierge service in
that the consultant should think of what their client needs before they
realize they need it.



 ### STEP 9: Create your business website



 After defining your brand and creating your logo the next step is to create
a website for your business.



 While creating a website is an essential step, some may fear that itâ€™s out of
their reach because they donâ€™t have any website-building experience. While
this may have been a reasonable fear back in 2015, web technology has seen
huge advancements in the past few years that makes the lives of small business
owners much simpler.



 Here are the main reasons why you shouldnâ€™t delay building your website:



   * **All legitimate businesses have websites** \- full stop. The size or industry of your business does not matter when it comes to getting your business online.
   * Social media accounts like **Facebook pages or LinkedIn business profiles are not a replacement for a business website** that you own.
   * Website builder tools like the GoDaddy Website Builder have made creating a basic website extremely simple. **You donâ€™t need to hire a web developer** or designer to create a website that you can be proud of.

Builders.

 ### STEP 10: Set up your business phone system



 Getting a phone set up for your business is one of the best ways to help keep
your personal life and business life separate and private. Thatâ€™s not the only
benefit; it also helps you make your business more automated, gives your
business legitimacy, and makes it easier for potential customers to find and
contact you.



 There are many services available to entrepreneurs who want to set up a
business phone system. Weâ€™ve reviewed the top companies and rated them based
on price, features, and ease of use. Check out our review of the Best
Business Phone Systems 2023 to find the best phone service for your small business.

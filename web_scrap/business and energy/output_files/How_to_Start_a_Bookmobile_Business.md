Bookmobiles offer a unique opportunity for the public to access reading
materials. Since librarian Mary Titcomb launched the first
bookmobile at the turn of the
20th century, these small businesses have served the reading needs of the
public in both rural and urban areas. Whether operating as a for-profit
business selling books to customers or a public service offered by some
libraries, bookmobiles bring entertainment and education to those who may not
otherwise have access to books.

While the popularity of bookmobiles waxed and waned during the past century,
these mobile bookstores and libraries remain uniquely equipped to meet the
needs of the modern reader. Since the early 2000s, the number of bookmobiles
has grown nationwide. That increase likely will accelerate in today's
environment with more people -- both adults and children -- staying home for
work and education. Bookmobiles can provide for the reading needs of their
communities by meeting residents wherever they're located.

fit for you.

### STEP 1: Plan your business

A clear plan is essential for success as an entrepreneur. It will help you map
out the specifics of your business and discover some unknowns. A few important
topics to consider are:

  * What will you name your business?
  * What are the startup and ongoing costs?
  * Who is your target market?
  * How much can you charge customers?

Luckily we have done a lot of this research for you.

#### What will you name your business?

Choosing the right name is important and challenging. If you don't already
have a name in mind, visit our How to Name a Business guide or get help brainstorming a name with our Business Name
Generator

If you operate a sole proprietorship, you
might want to operate under a business name other than your own name. Visit
our DBA guide to learn more.

When registering a business name, we
recommend researching your business name by checking:

  * Your state's business records
  * Federal and state trademark records
  * Social media platforms
  * Web domain availability.

It's very important to secure your domain name before someone else does.

#### What are the costs involved in opening a bookmobile business?

The costs for starting a bookmobile business can vary considerably, depending
on your requirements. Buying a new vehicle, equipping it for business with
shelves, etc., and purchasing an inventory of new books could cost more than
$100,000. On the low end, you could purchase a used vehicle for less than
$5,000, do the renovations yourself, and begin with a stock of used books. In
this case, you could potentially get started for $10,000 or less.

#### What are the ongoing expenses for a bookmobile business?

The average annual cost of keeping a bookmobile on the road is around
$200,000, according to the Association of Bookmobile and Outreach Services
ABOS.
The need to continually replenish your book inventory is obvious, but you also
must prepare for other ongoing expenses like vehicle repairs. You'll likely
need to drive your bookmobile every day, which results in wear and tear. As
with any work vehicle, you should budget for repairs as part of your business.

#### Who is the target market?

A bookmobile business can serve multiple market segments. Literature
enthusiasts, students, children, the elderly, and people without access to a
nearby library or bookstore all represent potential target markets.

#### How does a bookmobile business make money?

Bookmobile businesses make money by selling books and related items to the
public. Some bookmobiles may operate as nonprofits, such as those run by
libraries. Nonprofit bookmobiles typically receive public funding.

#### How much can you charge customers?

A bookmobile business sells similar products to bookstores at similar prices.
A typical paperback book can cost between $9.99 and $19.99 while hardcover
books tend to cost $27.99 and up.

#### How much profit can a bookmobile business make?

Independent bookselling typically isn't a highly lucrative business. Most
independent booksellers only manage a 2 percent to 3 percent profit
margin. If you can minimize your bookmobile operational
costs, you may be able to save some money over what you'd pay renting a brick-
and-mortar space for your business. But, you should still expect to run on
fairly thin profit margins.

#### How can you make your business more profitable?

You can make your business more profitable in several ways. First, try to find
items to sell in addition to books because you often can make a better profit
margin on them. Items like bookmarks, journals, and themed souvenirs can help
you boost your revenue. If your market demand will support it, operating more
than one bookmobile is another way to make your business more profitable. Once
you expand to multiple bookmobiles and can serve more of your area, you can
increase revenue while benefiting from economies of scale.

### STEP 2: Form a legal entity

The most common business structure types are
the sole proprietorship,
partnership, limited liability company
LLC, and corporation.

Establishing a legal business entity such as an **LLC** or **corporation**
protects you from being held personally liable if your bookmobile business is
sued.

### STEP 3: Register for taxes

You will need to register for a variety of state and federal taxes before you
can open for business.

In order to register for taxes you will need to apply for an EIN. It's really
easy and free!

You can acquire your EIN through the IRS
website. If you would like to learn more about EINs, read our
article, What is an EIN?

There are specific state taxes that might apply to your business. Learn more
about state sales tax and franchise taxes in our
state sales tax guides.

### STEP 4: Open a business bank account & credit card

Using dedicated business banking and credit accounts is essential for personal
asset protection.

When your personal and business accounts are mixed, your personal assets your
home, car, and other valuables are at risk in the event your business is
sued. In business law, this is referred to as piercing your corporate
veil.

#### Open a business bank account

Besides being a requirement when applying for business loans, opening a
business bank account:

  * Separates your personal assets from your company's assets, which is necessary for personal asset protection.
  * Makes accounting and tax filing easier.

**Recommended:** Read our Best Banks for Small Business review to find the best national bank or credit union.

#### Get a business credit card

Getting a business credit card helps you:

  * Separate personal and business expenses by putting your business' expenses all in one place.
  * Build your company's credit history, which can be useful to raise money later on.

**Recommended:** Apply for an easy approval business credit card from BILL and build your business credit quickly.

### STEP 5: Set up business accounting

Recording your various expenses and sources of income is critical to
understanding the financial performance of your business. Keeping accurate and
detailed accounts also greatly simplifies your annual tax filing.

### STEP 6: Obtain necessary permits and licenses

Failure to acquire necessary permits and licenses can result in hefty fines,
or even cause your business to be shut down.

#### State & Local Business Licensing Requirements

Certain state permits and licenses may be needed to operate an affiliate
marketing business. Learn more about licensing requirements in your state by
visiting SBA's reference to state licenses and
permits.

**Most businesses are required to collect sales tax on the goods or services
they provide.** To learn more about how sales tax will affect your business,
read our article, Sales Tax for Small Businesses.

### STEP 7: Get business insurance

Just as with licenses and permits, your business needs insurance in order to
operate safely and lawfully. **Business Insurance protects your company’s financial wellbeing in the event
of a covered loss.**

There are several types of insurance policies created for different types of
businesses with different risks. If you’re unsure of the types of risks that
your business may face, **begin withGeneral Liability Insurance**. This is the most common
coverage that small businesses need, so it’s a great place to start for your
business.

Another notable insurance policy that many businesses need is Workers’
Compensation Insurance. If your business will have employees, it’s a good chance that
your state will require you to carry Workers' Compensation Coverage.



 ### STEP 8: Define your brand
Your brand is what your company stands for, as well as how your business is
perceived by the public. A strong brand will help your business stand out from
competitors.



 #### How to promote & market a bookmobile business



 If you conduct community outreach before you start your business, you'll
already have some public recognition on which you can capitalize. But, you
must do a lot more to market your business. Start by making your bookmobile
memorable. Create a fun logo and paint your vehicle so people immediately
understand the nature of your business. Next, experiment with social media
marketing. Regular updates on social media channels that tell people about
your upcoming locations and offerings will help you attract more business.



 #### How to keep customers coming back



 Personalized service is the key to enticing customers back to your
bookmobile. If you can help your customers find books they love, they'll
return again and again. It's also important to keep customers informed of your
location and offerings. Because your business moves around, you have to let
people know where to find you.



 ### STEP 9: Create your business website



 After defining your brand and creating your logo the next step is to create
a website for your business.



 While creating a website is an essential step, some may fear that it’s out of
their reach because they don’t have any website-building experience. While
this may have been a reasonable fear back in 2015, web technology has seen
huge advancements in the past few years that makes the lives of small business
owners much simpler.



 Here are the main reasons why you shouldn’t delay building your website:



   * **All legitimate businesses have websites** \- full stop. The size or industry of your business does not matter when it comes to getting your business online.
   * Social media accounts like **Facebook pages or LinkedIn business profiles are not a replacement for a business website** that you own.
   * Website builder tools like the GoDaddy Website Builder have made creating a basic website extremely simple. **You don’t need to hire a web developer** or designer to create a website that you can be proud of.

builder or check out our review of the Best Website
Builders.



 Other popular website builders are: WordPress, WIX, Weebly, Squarespace, and
Shopify.



 ### STEP 10: Set up your business phone system



 Getting a phone set up for your business is one of the best ways to help keep
your personal life and business life separate and private. That’s not the only
benefit; it also helps you make your business more automated, gives your
business legitimacy, and makes it easier for potential customers to find and
contact you.



 There are many services available to entrepreneurs who want to set up a
business phone system. We’ve reviewed the top companies and rated them based
on price, features, and ease of use. Check out our review of the Best
Business Phone Systems 2023 to find the best phone service for your small business.

 ## Is this Business Right For You?



 Book lovers make obvious candidates to start a bookmobile business. But, a
passion for books isn't enough -- you also must enjoy interacting with the
public and traveling a fair bit. If you love books and want to share that love
with others in a mobile environment, you're probably the right fit for this
business idea.




 ### What happens during a typical day at a bookmobile business?



 A typical day at a bookmobile business starts with preparing the bookmobile
for travel. You may already know your route or you may need to determine that
before you hit the road. Once you head out, you must get your bookmobile
safely to your destination and open for business before you can start serving
the public.



  


 After you open for business, you'll spend your time helping customers and
keeping your inventory organized. Customers will ask for suggestions, and some
may be quite eager to talk for hours about their favorite books. Your job will
require the ability to successfully juggle friendly customer service with the
practical needs of running your business.



 At the end of the day, you'll need to close up shop and prepare to hit the
road again. Once you return to your home base, you must prepare for the next
day and lock up.



 ### What are some skills and experiences that will help you build a
successful bookmobile business?



 Book knowledge is one of the most important skills a bookmobile business
owner needs because many of your customers will ask for recommendations. The
more widely you read -- both fiction and nonfiction books -- the better
equipped you'll be to provide personalized recommendations and build rapport
with your customers.



 Customer service is another key skill bookmobile business owners need. To
attract customers and keep them coming back, you must make a positive
impression and know how to keep customers happy.



 Auto repair experience is another useful, but perhaps not obvious requirement
for this line of work. Like all automobiles, bookmobiles can break down from
time to time. The better you are at fixing your vehicle, the less money you'll
need to spend on repairs.



 ### What is the growth potential for a bookmobile business?



 The growth potential for a bookmobile business depends on the size of the
market in which it operates. A bookmobile business in a rural area, for
example, may be able to meet market demand with a single bookmobile. In
contrast, a bookmobile business in an urban area could expand into operating
multiple bookmobiles to meet local demand. Another popular option for
expansion is to open a brick-and-mortar bookstore after your bookmobile
business develops name recognition.

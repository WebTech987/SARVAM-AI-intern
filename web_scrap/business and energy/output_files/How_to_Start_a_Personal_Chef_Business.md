### STEP 1: Plan your business

A clear plan is essential for success as an entrepreneur. It will help you map
out the specifics of your business and discover some unknowns. A few important
topics to consider are:

  * What will you name your business?
  * What are the startup and ongoing costs?
  * Who is your target market?
  * How much can you charge customers?

Luckily we have done a lot of this research for you.

#### What will you name your business?

Choosing the right name is important and challenging. If you don't already
have a name in mind, visit our How to Name a Business guide or get help brainstorming a name with our Personal Chef
Business Name Generator

If you operate a sole proprietorship, you
might want to operate under a business name other than your own name. Visit
our DBA guide to learn more.

When registering a business name, we
recommend researching your business name by checking:

  * Your state's business records
  * Federal and state trademark records
  * Social media platforms
  * Web domain availability.

It's very important to secure your domain name before someone else does.

#### What are the costs involved in opening a personal chef business?

A personal chef must purchase cooking supplies, food, food storage containers,
rent/purchase space to prepare meals, obtain liability insurance, and invest
in marketing efforts. One must pay a fee to obtain a license, permit, and Food
Safety Certification.

#### What are the ongoing expenses for a personal chef business?

Personal chefs must pay for food, cooking supplies, a space for food
preparation, utilities, high-speed Internet for recipe research purposes,
liability insurance, rent, advertising, and labor. However, labor costs are
typically non-existent or quite low when the business first starts. If you add
a food prep assistant, they will likely earn between $10 and $15 per hour. If
you opt to prepare meals from a space outside your home, monthly rent will
likely run between $600 and $1,200 depending on the size and location.
Utilities for such a food prep space will likely run $50 to $100 per month.
High-speed Internet will likely cost around $50 per month.

Food costs hinge on the number of clients you recruit. The cost can range from
around $400 per month to several thousands for multiple clients. Cooking
supplies will eventually deteriorate. You will likely spend at least $50 to
$100 on new cooking supplies each month. Budget in $100 to $200 per month for
advertising purposes. A marketing professional might be necessary if the
business expands across posterity. This professional will earn between $30,000
and $50,000 per year.

#### Who is the target market?

The ideal customer is a wealthy individual who is willing to refer the
personal chef to other wealthy colleagues and friends. Personal chefs tend to
prefer cooking for individuals who enjoy a wide variety of foods and are
willing to try new dishes. Businesses and other organizations are also coveted
as clients as they are comprised of numerous individuals. An abundance of
mouths to feed means more money for the personal chef.

#### How does a personal chef business make money?

Personal chefs make money by charging customers a fee for food preparation,
on-site cooking, grocery shopping, and nutritional advice.

#### How much can you charge customers?

Most personal chefs charge between $35 and $50 per hour. Some charge a daily
or weekly rate that hinges on the number of meals prepared. If you are
particularly successful and secure the business of especially wealthy clients,
you will likely be able to charge upwards of $75 or more per hour.

#### How much profit can a personal chef business make?

The average personal chef makes around $40,000 per year. However, those with
years of experience and an expansive client base make upwards of six figures
per year. The best of the best build a brand and earn several hundred thousand
dollars or even millions of dollars per year.

#### How can you make your business more profitable?

Personal chefs can boost profitability by going out of their way to build new
relationships with those who are interested in their services. Even
befriending someone who is not a "foodie" can lead to a reference to an
individual who is willing to pay top-dollar for a personal chef. Personal
chefs can also bolster their bottom line by teaching others how to cook,
writing cookbooks, operating a popular website, and making cooking videos for
YouTube. It is also possible to sell old cooking equipment when upgrading to
new cookware.

### STEP 2: Form a legal entity

The most common business structure types are
the sole proprietorship,
partnership, limited liability company
LLC, and corporation.

Establishing a legal business entity such as an **LLC** or **corporation**
protects you from being held personally liable if your personal chef business
is sued.
You can form an LLC yourself and
pay only the minimal state LLC costs or hire one of
the Best LLC Services for a small, additional fee.

**Recommended:** You will need to elect a registered agent for your LLC. LLC formation packages usually include a free year of
registered agent services. You can
choose to hire a registered agent or act as your own.

### STEP 3: Register for taxes

You will need to register for a variety of state and federal taxes before you
can open for business.

In order to register for taxes you will need to apply for an EIN. It's really
easy and free!

You can acquire your EIN through the IRS
website. If you would like to learn more about EINs, read our
article, What is an EIN?

There are specific state taxes that might apply to your business. Learn more
about state sales tax and franchise taxes in our
state sales tax guides.

### STEP 4: Open a business bank account & credit card

Using dedicated business banking and credit accounts is essential for personal
asset protection.

When your personal and business accounts are mixed, your personal assets your
home, car, and other valuables are at risk in the event your business is
sued. In business law, this is referred to as piercing your corporate
veil.

#### Open a business bank account

Besides being a requirement when applying for business loans, opening a
business bank account:

  * Separates your personal assets from your company's assets, which is necessary for personal asset protection.
  * Makes accounting and tax filing easier.

#### Get a business credit card

Getting a business credit card helps you:

  * Separate personal and business expenses by putting your business' expenses all in one place.
  * Build your company's credit history, which can be useful to raise money later on.

**Recommended:** Apply for an easy approval business credit card from BILL and build your business credit quickly.

### STEP 5: Set up business accounting

Recording your various expenses and sources of income is critical to
understanding the financial performance of your business. Keeping accurate and
detailed accounts also greatly simplifies your annual tax filing.

### STEP 6: Obtain necessary permits and licenses

Failure to acquire necessary permits and licenses can result in hefty fines,
or even cause your business to be shut down.

#### State & Local Business Licensing Requirements

Certain state permits and licenses may be needed to operate a personal chef
business. Learn more about licensing requirements in your state by visiting
SBA's reference to state licenses and permits.

For information about local licenses and permits:

  * Check with your town, city or county clerk's office
  * Get assistance from one of the local associations listed in US Small Business Associations directory of local business resources.

**Most businesses are required to collect sales tax on the goods or services
they provide.** To learn more about how sales tax will affect your business,
read our article, Sales Tax for Small Businesses.

#### Services Contract

In business where services are provided on an extended basis, a services
contract is often put in place outlining terms and conditions of service.

Personal chef businesses should require clients to sign a services agreement
before starting a new project.  This agreement should clarify client
expectations and minimize risk of legal disputes by setting out payment terms
and conditions, and service level expectations. Here is an example of such a
service
agreement.

**Recommended:** Rocket Lawyer makes it easy to create a professional service
agreement for your personal chef business when you sign up for their premium
membership. For $39.95 per month, members receive access to hundreds of legal
agreements and on call attorneys to get complimentary legal advice.

### STEP 7: Get business insurance

Just as with licenses and permits, your business needs insurance in order to
operate safely and lawfully. **Business Insurance protects your company’s financial wellbeing in the event
of a covered loss.**

There are several types of insurance policies created for different types of
businesses with different risks. If you’re unsure of the types of risks that
your business may face, **begin withGeneral Liability Insurance**. This is the most common
coverage that small businesses need, so it’s a great place to start for your
business.

Another notable insurance policy that many businesses need is Workers’
Compensation Insurance. If your business will have employees, it’s a good chance that
your state will require you to carry Workers' Compensation Coverage.

 ### STEP 8: Define your brand



 Your brand is what your company stands for, as well as how your business is
perceived by the public. A strong brand will help your business stand out from
competitors.

Free QR Code Generator. Choose from 13 QR code types to
create a code for your business cards and publications, or to help spread
awareness for your new website.



 #### How to promote & market a personal chef business



 The best way to market your business is to connect with others in your
community. Let people know you run a personal chef business. Attend networking
events, conferences, seminars, and other community events to befriend locals.
Pass out business cards and post flyers that tout your business. It also helps
to have a visually captivating website with insightful content. Take the
opportunity to post content to your blog and social media platforms to
establish yourself as a true expert in your niche and improve your search
engine optimization SEO.



 #### How to keep customers coming back



 Interact with fellow professionals, community members, and "foodies". In some
instances, personal chefs obtain steady business from establishing inroads
with a single client who recommends his services to others. Target those who
are wealthy. The vast majority of people are unwilling to pay for a personal
chef. Your clients will likely be wealthy professionals, food enthusiasts,
athletes, or uber-busy individuals who do not have time to cook.



 ### STEP 9: Create your business website



 After defining your brand and creating your logo the next step is to create
a website for your business.



 While creating a website is an essential step, some may fear that it’s out of
their reach because they don’t have any website-building experience. While
this may have been a reasonable fear back in 2015, web technology has seen
huge advancements in the past few years that makes the lives of small business
owners much simpler.



 Here are the main reasons why you shouldn’t delay building your website:



   * **All legitimate businesses have websites** \- full stop. The size or industry of your business does not matter when it comes to getting your business online.
   * Social media accounts like **Facebook pages or LinkedIn business profiles are not a replacement for a business website** that you own.
   * Website builder tools like the GoDaddy Website Builder have made creating a basic website extremely simple. **You don’t need to hire a web developer** or designer to create a website that you can be proud of.

Builders.

Shopify.



 ### STEP 10: Set up your business phone system



 Getting a phone set up for your business is one of the best ways to help keep
your personal life and business life separate and private. That’s not the only
benefit; it also helps you make your business more automated, gives your
business legitimacy, and makes it easier for potential customers to find and
contact you.



 There are many services available to entrepreneurs who want to set up a
business phone system. We’ve reviewed the top companies and rated them based
on price, features, and ease of use. Check out our review of the Best

 ## Is this Business Right For You?



 This business is perfect for individuals who have a passion for tasty food
and the cooking process. Those who are interested in creating fulfilling meals
and healthy dishes that suit the nuanced palates of clients will thrive in
this business.





 ### What happens during a typical day at a personal chef business?



 The typical personal chef spends the majority of his day preparing dishes for
his clients. Many of these meals are created at the client's property. Some
meals are partially prepared at the personal chef's home or another space
designated for food preparation. Personal chefs also spend time researching
recipes, new cooking techniques, and cooking equipment. They also handle
client billing, marketing, logistics matters, and scheduling.



 ### What are some skills and experiences that will help you build a
successful personal chef business?



 One's success as a personal chef hinges on their culinary skills. It is also
important to take risks, try new ingredient combinations, and create new
dishes. The best personal chefs customize each meal to the nuanced desires of
the client. It also helps to be personable. Clients enjoy interacting with
their personal chef. If one cannot hold a lengthy conversation, establish
meaningful bonds with prospective and current clients, and persuade potential
clients to sign up for meal service, they will struggle to succeed in this
business.



 ### What is the growth potential for a personal chef business?



 The most successful personal chefs steadily add clients as time progresses.
If they do not cook for the majority of their clients on-site, they can add
employees for food preparation purposes. The most successful personal chefs
establish well-known brands with regional, national, and even worldwide
appeal. Some personal chefs become so successful that they develop into
international icons with acclaimed cookbooks, TV cooking shows, and restaurant
chains.

**!Urban Mobility and Its Impact on Local
BusinessesOperating a successful small business
requires more than marketing or product manufacturing experience. You also
have to understand your consumer base’s current and future needs. Urban
mobility is a crucial indicator for both of those driving factors. Read this
guide to learn everything you need to know about the vital concept for small
business owners.**

## What Is Urban Mobility?

Urban mobility is a term regarding how easily people can get around their
towns and how that mobility **facilitates happier and more productive
lives** for everyone
in the surrounding area. It takes into account how easy it is to:

  * Commute to work.
  * Shop at local businesses.
  * Attend leisure activities.
  * Visit cultural venues.
  * Dine at restaurants of all sizes.

Urban mobility is a broad term local leaders can use to assess their
community’s needs and predict where people spend their time.

## Why Is It Important?

Small business owners should understand urban mobility because it affects
where consumers shop and what they need. People who own cars can visit any
business with a parking lot. Individuals relying on public transportation may
only visit places near bus or metro stations because they have to walk
elsewhere. A crowd-pleasing urban mobility plan includes both options.

Urban mobility also indicates consumer preferences regarding sustainability.
If more local residents want greener public transportation to minimize
individual reliance on fossil fuels in private vehicles, nearby businesses can
adjust their sustainability to attract or retain those consumers more
effectively.

## Ways Urban Mobility Impacts Local Businesses

Understanding urban mobility is easier by breaking the idea down into
practical implications for local business owners. These are the primary
changes happening in towns and cities.

### 1\. It Makes Businesses More Accessible

Urban mobility looks at consumer needs for people with private cars and those
who use public transportation. The broadened scope also includes people who
bike around town, ride electric scooters or walk to their preferred shops.

If city planners and business owners work together to make storefront
locations more accessible to everyone, businesses will watch their consumer
bases grow. Efforts may include installing bike racks by front doors, making
parking lots easier to navigate or working with local city governments to
create additional public transportation stops.

### 2. **It Improves the Consumer Experience**

Business owners often have commercial real estate that’s notably smaller than
the parking lot surrounding it. Consumers want to park close to the front
doors of the stores they frequent.

In contrast, parking scarcity provides consumers with what they want —
availability within shorter walking distance — but only when **combined with
proper urban planning**. Oversized parking lots taking up
excess space and a lack of parking spots altogether both make the experience
worse for the consumer. Urban mobility encourages business owners to create
walkable shopping areas with less parking to minimize the distance consumers
need to travel between businesses.

### **3\. It Creates Greener Towns**

Research shows consumers with no intent to switch to electric vehicles EVs
**shrank from 23% to 19%** in
2022, making EVs a more common household car in the near future. Urban
mobility planning takes this into consideration. Local business owners and
government officials could install charging stations to make parking lots more
welcoming to EV owners.

Some businesses may optimize their parking by reducing their lot size as well.
It would make most of the parking lot closer to their front doors, but it also
impresses sustainable consumer bases by removing concrete or asphalt. Restored
ground exposure eradicates water runoff issues and helps rainwater reach the
local environment more efficiently. It’s another way urban mobility planning
makes cities greener while helping business owners and consumers.

## Plan for the Near Future

Local businesses can use urban mobility planning ideas to improve their
success and expand their consumer base. Take note of how customers utilize
large parking lots or public transportation. Anticipate consumer needs so that
simple changes can be made that will boost business revenue.

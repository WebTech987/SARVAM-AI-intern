inspector will suggest that the individual hire an expert to get a more
qualified opinion if there are tell-tale signs of damage.

### STEP 1: Plan your business

A clear plan is essential for success as an entrepreneur. It will help you map
out the specifics of your business and discover some unknowns. A few important
topics to consider are:

  * What will you name your business?
  * What are the startup and ongoing costs?
  * Who is your target market?
  * How much can you charge customers?

Luckily we have done a lot of this research for you.

#### What will you name your business?

Choosing the right name is important and challenging. If you don't already
have a name in mind, visit our How to Name a Business guide or get help brainstorming a name with our Home Inspection
Business Name Generator

If you operate a sole proprietorship, you
might want to operate under a business name other than your own name. Visit
our DBA guide to learn more.

When registering a business name, we
recommend researching your business name by checking:

  * Your state's business records
  * Federal and state trademark records
  * Social media platforms
  * Web domain availability.

It's very important to secure your domain name before someone else does.

#### What are the costs involved in opening a home inspection business?

Obtaining training and certification
is one of the initial costs, and obtaining a business license is another. Home
Inspection insurance is also a crucial startup cost, since customers will be
advised to hire inspectors who carry it for the protection of both parties.
Other startup costs include a dependable vehicle and some basic office and
inspection equipment. Essential office equipment includes a computer capable
of running home inspection software, telephone, fax, color copier, and a quality digital
camera. You'll also need a desk, chairs, and shelving as well as report
binders and business cards. Basic inspection tools include ladders $200-$500
and testing equipment such gas and moisture detectors, circuit tester and a
voltage "sniffer", and an infrared thermometer. You'll also need some basic
tools such as screwdrivers and pliers. Depending on whether your equipment is
new or used, startup costs can range from $10,000 to $30,000.

#### What are the ongoing expenses for a home inspection business?

Ongoing expenses for a home inspection business include:

  * Maintaining a business license and professional liability insurance
  * Office supplies
  * Vehicle and equipment maintenance
  * Continuing education

#### Who is the target market?

Preferred customers are homebuyers, real estate agents, and mortgage lenders.

#### How does a home inspection business make money?

A home inspection business makes money by charging clients for their time,
experience and expertise in discovering potentially costly damage as well as
any safety hazards in homes for sale, thereby saving homebuyers money.

#### How much can you charge customers?

The cost of a home inspection depends on the size and complexity of
the structure or structures to be inspected. Fees range from $200 to $470,
with an average of approximately $325. A separate termite inspection typically
costs $300, while an inspection for the presence of radon gas averages $750.
The more training and equipment your home inspection business has, the more
earning opportunities it will have also.

#### How much profit can a home inspection business make?

Annual income for home inspectors, depending upon education and
experience, ranges between $26,000 and $66,000, with an average of $45,000.
Unlike other types of businesses, people own their homes for an average of
eight years, which means that any repeat business is unlikely to come from
clients, though it may come through recommendations from real estate agents or
mortgage lenders.

#### How can you make your business more profitable?

One way to make your business more profitable is by advertising how much money
your services are saving your clients. Home inspections are routinely used as
a contingency in purchase offers, which means that your services can result in
your clients being able to back out of a contract with no financial penalty. A
home inspection is a money- saving investment. By acquiring vital information
about the condition of a home, your clients can save thousands of dollars by
making a counter-offer that takes needed repairs into consideration.

### STEP 2: Form a legal entity

The most common business structure types are
the sole proprietorship,
partnership, limited liability company
LLC, and corporation.

Establishing a legal business entity such as an **LLC** or **corporation**
protects you from being held personally liable if your home inspection
business is sued.


### STEP 3: Register for taxes

You will need to register for a variety of state and federal taxes before you
can open for business.

In order to register for taxes you will need to apply for an EIN. It's really
easy and free!

You can acquire your EIN through the IRS
website. If you would like to learn more about EINs, read our
article, What is an EIN?

There are specific state taxes that might apply to your business. Learn more
about state sales tax and franchise taxes in our
state sales tax guides.

### STEP 4: Open a business bank account & credit card

Using dedicated business banking and credit accounts is essential for personal
asset protection.

When your personal and business accounts are mixed, your personal assets your
home, car, and other valuables are at risk in the event your business is
sued. In business law, this is referred to as piercing your corporate
veil.

#### Open a business bank account

Besides being a requirement when applying for business loans, opening a
business bank account:

  * Separates your personal assets from your company's assets, which is necessary for personal asset protection.
  * Makes accounting and tax filing easier.

**Recommended:** Read our Best Banks for Small Business review to find the best national bank or credit union.

#### Get a business credit card

Getting a business credit card helps you:

  * Separate personal and business expenses by putting your business' expenses all in one place.
  * Build your company's credit history, which can be useful to raise money later on.

**Recommended:** Apply for an easy approval business credit card from BILL and build your business credit quickly.

### STEP 5: Set up business accounting

Recording your various expenses and sources of income is critical to
understanding the financial performance of your business. Keeping accurate and
detailed accounts also greatly simplifies your annual tax filing.

### STEP 6: Obtain necessary permits and licenses

Failure to acquire necessary permits and licenses can result in hefty fines,
or even cause your business to be shut down.

#### State & Local Business Licensing Requirements

Certain state business permits or licenses may be needed to go into business
as Home Inspector. Learn more about licensing requirements in your state by
visiting SBA's reference to state licenses and
permits.

For more information about local licenses and permits:

  * Check with your town, city or county clerk's office
  * Get assistance from one of the local associations listed in US Small Business Associations directory of local business resources

**Most businesses are required to collect sales tax on the goods or services
they provide.** To learn more about how sales tax will affect your business,
read our article, Sales Tax for Small Businesses.

#### Home Inspector Licensing

Home Inspector Licensing is generally regulated by having pre-license learning
requirements that vary state to state. While some states do not require
prerequisites for receiving a Home Inspector License, it is a process that
many states are trying to legislate due to requests from realtors and
homebuyers. Additionally, becoming AHIT certified will increase the
competitiveness of a home inspector where there is still no state requirement.
Here is a state-by-state map of Home Inspection Licensing
requirements.

#### Service Contract

Home Inspection Businesses should require clients to sign a service agreement
before starting a new project. This agreement should clarify client
expectations and minimize risk of legal disputes by setting out payment terms,
conditions and service level expectations.  Here is an example service
agreement.

**Recommended:** Rocket Lawyer makes it easy to create a professional service
agreement for your home inspection business when you sign up for their
premium membership. For $39.95 per month, members receive access to hundreds
of legal agreements and on call attorneys to get complimentary legal advice.

### STEP 7: Get business insurance

Just as with licenses and permits, your business needs insurance in order to
operate safely and lawfully. **Business Insurance protects your company’s financial wellbeing in the event
of a covered loss.**

There are several types of insurance policies created for different types of
businesses with different risks. If you’re unsure of the types of risks that
your business may face, **begin withGeneral Liability Insurance**. This is the most common
coverage that small businesses need, so it’s a great place to start for your
business.

Another notable insurance policy that many businesses need is Workers’
Compensation Insurance. If your business will have employees, it’s a good chance that
your state will require you to carry Workers' Compensation Coverage.

 ### STEP 8: Define your brand



 Your brand is what your company stands for, as well as how your business is
perceived by the public. A strong brand will help your business stand out from
competitors.

awareness for your new website.



 #### How to promote & market a home inspection business



 One of the best ways to promote your business is by attending events such as
open houses where you can network with realtors and potential home buyers.
Leaving your business card with local residential construction companies is
also an effective way to gain an edge over the competition.



 #### How to keep customers coming back



 In this business, licensing requirements vary from state to state. That fact,
coupled with the high level of personal trust required, is one reason that
word of mouth is the most important element of any advertising campaign.
Satisfied customers who have saved money and have been able to increase the
level of safety for themselves and their families as a result of your services
speak louder than words on a flyer.



 ### STEP 9: Create your business website



 After defining your brand and creating your logo the next step is to create
a website for your business.



 While creating a website is an essential step, some may fear that it’s out of
their reach because they don’t have any website-building experience. While
this may have been a reasonable fear back in 2015, web technology has seen
huge advancements in the past few years that makes the lives of small business
owners much simpler.



 Here are the main reasons why you shouldn’t delay building your website:



   * **All legitimate businesses have websites** \- full stop. The size or industry of your business does not matter when it comes to getting your business online.
   * Social media accounts like **Facebook pages or LinkedIn business profiles are not a replacement for a business website** that you own.
   * Website builder tools like the GoDaddy Website Builder have made creating a basic website extremely simple. **You don’t need to hire a web developer** or designer to create a website that you can be proud of.

builder or check out our review of the Best Website
Builders.



 Other popular website builders are: WordPress, WIX, Weebly, Squarespace, and
Shopify.



 ### STEP 10: Set up your business phone system



 Getting a phone set up for your business is one of the best ways to help keep
your personal life and business life separate and private. That’s not the only
benefit; it also helps you make your business more automated, gives your
business legitimacy, and makes it easier for potential customers to find and
contact you.



 There are many services available to entrepreneurs who want to set up a
business phone system. We’ve reviewed the top companies and rated them based
on price, features, and ease of use. Check out our review of the Best
Business Phone Systems 2023 to find the best phone service for your small business.


 ### What happens during a typical day at a home inspection business?



 Daily activities performed by the owners of this type of business include:



   * Scheduling appointments with clients
   * Exterior inspection of walls, foundation, grading, drainage, garage, and roof
   * Interior inspection of plumbing, electrical, heating, air conditioning and ventilation systems
   * Fire safety inspection of water heater and all appliances
   * Communicating with clients, real estate agents, and bank representatives
   * Compiling detailed written reports of all findings
   * Recommending repairs and/or more in-depth inspections by experts
   * Sales and marketing
   * Filing and archiving




 ### What are some skills and experiences that will help you build a
successful home inspection business?



 Skills essential for success in this business include:



   * Technical knowledge that encompasses a thorough understanding all house systems as well as insulation. A basic education designed specifically for this business is available through many community colleges or even online courses.
   * Verbal communication skills to discuss key findings with clients.
   * Report writing and basic photography skills for purposes of illustration. Detailed reports establish credibility and minimize liability in the event of a dispute and home buyers depend on them to receive financing and/or insurance approval.
   * Business and marketing skills to supplement there is a higher reliance on word of mouth advertising because a satisfied customer speaks much more clearly than a constructed advertisement for the service.




 ### What is the growth potential for a home inspection business?



 Some home inspection businesses have become successful enough to offer
franchise
opportunities. The benefits of franchises include assistance in
obtaining insurance, reporting tools, ready-made contracts, continuing
education opportunities and mentoring by a network of experienced
professionals.

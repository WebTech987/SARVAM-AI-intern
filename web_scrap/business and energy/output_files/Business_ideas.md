## What makes a good small business idea?

Not all small business ideas are made equal: Some require more effort and
funding than others, while some can be launched with few resources — or
resources you already have. As a potential small business owner, you’ll want
to save as much money as possible on training, rent, supplies, and other
necessities.

Let’s go over what makes a good business idea:

  * **Requires little to no training**. A good small business idea will ideally leverage your existing field of expertise and require little to no training. That will not only shorten your time-to-launch, but also lessen your expenses, since training courses can cost a significant amount of money. Plus, you’ll be more confident offering services that you feel prepared to deliver.
  * **Requires low setup costs.** Your business should be cheap to start. Maybe you only need to purchase a website domain or buy a desk for your garage.
  * **Requires little hands-on inventory or supply management**. A great business idea needs few supplies and little inventory management. If you want to sell physical goods, you can either try drop-shipping and manually make goods in small batches.
  * **Is based online**. The best small business ideas are based online and can be carried out from your personal computer. This will automatically lower your commuting costs and give you greater flexibility over your personal and work life.
  * **Can sustainably be managed by few people**. As a small business owner, you won’t have the funds to hire other people to help you run your business — at least not at first. A good business idea should give you the ability to run your business on your own.

## Best Small Business Ideas

Airbnb Co-founder, Brian Chesky, said, "If we tried to think of a good idea,
we wouldn’t have been able to think of a good idea. You just have to find the
solution for a problem in your own life."

If you’re like Brian and you’ve already thought about a solution for a problem
you encounter in your life — or you’re on the path to doing so — then starting
a small business may be in your future. It may also be for you if you dream of
clocking out of your nine-to-five job for the last time and becoming your own
boss.

Below, we include the absolute best ideas for you to start your small business
— with resources and examples to help you get started.

### 1\. Handyman

!small business idea example: handyman

Image Source

Are you always fixing things around the house? Often on-call when friends need
small projects completed? Create a website, conduct a
competitive analysis to determine what your time and expertise are worth, and
turn to the friends you’ve helped before for referrals.

A handyman business is a good idea if you’ve already built a robust set of
skills to help others fix up their homes. Consider specializing in what you
feel well-prepared to do — for instance, if you know your way underneath a
sink and water system, then you might provide sink fixing services to start,
then expand your offerings once you earn more skills.

No certifications are needed to become a handyman, and there are no special
education requirements. You might need, however, a license if you’re planning
to undertake jobs worth more than a certain dollar amount. Some states might
not require this license.

To start your handyman business, we recommend the following resources:

  * Handyman License Requirements by State
  * The Most Requested Handyman Services 
  * Association of Certified Handyman Professionals

### 2\. Woodworker

Similarly, if you have a passion for crafting beautiful furniture or other
home goods out of wood, that could be a small business niche for you. Get
started by listing a few of your pieces on sites like
Etsy. Once you build a following, consider starting a
website, accepting custom orders, or expanding to refinishing work and
upholstery.

A woodworker small business is ideal if you already have a passion for
woodworking, as well as the tools to begin fulfilling orders as they begin to
come in. Since delivering a well-made product is key to keeping your customers
happy, you don’t want to be “training” as you create a custom shelf or a
custom storage box. It’s recommended to have at least one year of experience
as a woodworking apprentice.

To start a woodworking business, there are no special education requirements,
but there are a wide range of woodworking training certifications online, so
we suggest starting with a certification. The Woodwork
Institute,
YesTomorrow,
and The School of Fine Woodworking are
potential places to start.

### 3\. Online Dating Consultant

Dating consultants usually charge for their time. They help people create
successful online dating profiles, source possible matches from outside the
typical online channels, and offer a level of personalization that a site like
Tinder can’t. Think you’ve got a knack for the match? This might be the
business for you.

Online dating consultants need to have strong communication and interpersonal
skills, as well as heightened levels of empathy. The good news is that there
are no special education or licensure requirements, though we recommend
getting a certification such as IAP College’s relationship coach
certification or Hart Academy’s online dating coach
certificate.

To start an online dating consultant business, you’ll need a website that
shares all about you and offers free dating resources your customers might
benefit from. Once they download a resource, you can loop them in for a free
consultation.

### 4\. Sewing and Alteration Specialist

!small business idea example: sewing and
alterations

Image Source

People will always need clothing hemmed and buttons mended — and you could be
the person to do it. If you love sewing and have a sewing machine at home,
start by offering simple services like those mentioned above and expand your
repertoire to dressmaking and design as you build a customer base and demand.

You don’t need a special license or degree to begin a sewing and alterations
business, but it’s essential to build your skills so you can take on more
complicated projects. High-value clients will want to customize complicated
items of clothing such as suits, pants, gowns, and dresses. That’s where
you’ll see the highest potential for profits.

Altering these items require special skills, however. A few courses you might
consider include:

  * International Open Academy's Tailoring Course for Beginners
  * Jackson Sewing Academy’s Basic Alterations Course
  * American Bespoke Tailoring Academy’s Programs

You’ll also need to shop for sewing supplies of all colors to accommodate your
clients.

### 5\. Freelance Developer

From building websites for other small businesses to providing technical
support for certain projects, quality web
development is in
high demand right now. As a web developer, you'll naturally have a technical
skill set. Distill your knowledge and expertise so customers who don't have
your experience are able to understand what it is you'll be helping them
achieve.

To help with this, test your messaging on friends and family who don’t have a
firm understanding of the work you do. If they’re able to summarize what you
do, your messaging is likely effective among people outside of your industry.
You can start finding your first freelance contracts by visiting different
freelance websites.

Unlike a few other options in this list, a freelance developer does need some
training to launch a successful business and start taking on projects, but if
you’re a beginner, don’t worry. There are plenty of boot camps to get you up
to speed with either full-stack or front-end web development. Some of these
boot camps are even offered through accredited tech schools.

Some boot camps you might consider include:

  * Coding Dojo
  * Fullstack Academy
  * Georgia Institute of Technology Coding Boot Camp 

These vary in price, so be sure to do extensive research to find one that fits
you and your budget.

### 6\. Personal Trainer

Offer in-home consultations, personalized nutrition and exercise regimens, and
community boot camps to get the word out. Don’t forget to populate an
Instagram feed with inspirational quotes, free exercise videos, and yummy
snack ideas as well — it’s a common way for fitness gurus to build their
brands in our digital world.

If you choose to go this route, it’s OK to start small at first, then scale
up. For instance, MOURfit is a personal training
business in Indianapolis that started in a shared gym, then grew to a private
gym that offers group fitness, personal training, and nutrition services.

To start a personal training business, you’ll need a certification. If you
already earned a degree in an unrelated discipline, we recommend starting with
the NASM-CPT certification,
which is nationally accredited and only requires a high school diploma or GED.
You can also get a Bachelor’s degree in physical and exercise science —
here’s one example from Emory & Henry
College.

### 7\. Freelance Graphic Designer

Set your own hours, choose your projects, and build a portfolio and business
you’re proud of. From website design to blog graphics and more, many companies
seek out experienced graphic designers for support on a variety of projects.

The good news? There are no special education requirements for becoming a
freelance graphic designer, though we recommend seeking a credential (like
SAIC’s graphic design certificate or RISD’s graphic design
certificate)
or an Associate’s degree in design so you can confidently present your
portfolio and complete your first few projects.

If you’re just starting out with graphic design, try these tips and
tricks that are
ideal for beginners. If you’re more experienced but need to build your
portfolio to attract clients, these prompts will get
your creativity flowing in no time. We also recommend reviewing other people’s
work on portfolio websites to get a feel for
what is “trendy” and receive feedback as you grow your small business.

### 8\. Life/ Career Coach

If you have experience navigating career, personal, and social transitions
successfully, put it to good use as a life or career coach. Many of us are
looking for guidance in our careers — and finding someone with the time to
mentor us can be tough.

Life/career coaches don’t come cheap, but they are able to offer clients the
intense and hands-on training and advice they need to make serious moves in
their personal and professional lives. After all, everyone needs some
uplifting advice from time to time.

To start your life/career coaching business with confidence, you can look for
a certification program (like the Life Coach
School’s or Diane
Hudson’s), then apply your skills as you
acquire new clients.

!small business idea example: Career Coach Nariah
Broadus

helping people create better working environments and navigate change
successfully as a career and leadership coach. Check out her
story for more inspiration to get started

### 9\. Resume Writer

Creating a resume, cover letter, and — when necessary — portfolio for a new
job can be tough and time-consuming. That’s why many people hire help. Assist
clients with tailored resumes, beautifully edited cover letters, and
carefully-crafted portfolios that make it impossible for employers to ignore.
And if you’re feeling nervous about writing resumes from scratch, you can use
the templates below to get started:

[![→ Download Now: 12 Resume Templates \[Free Download\]](https://no-

redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/53/4ec95757-585e-40cf-9189-6b3885074e98)

A resume writing business is economical, has few overhead costs, and has few
educational requirements. We still recommend having an Associate’s or
Bachelor’s degree and a few resume samples on hand. If you still feel that you
need to brush up on your resume writing skills, you can take a course like
Coursera’s or LinkedIn
Learning’s.

Once you’ve gotten resume writing down, you can expand your business to
include cover letter writing, and even offer career coaching services in
conjunction with these services.

### 10\. Freelance Writer

If you have writing
skills,
there’s someone out there willing to pay you for them. Write blog posts,
magazine articles, and website copy galore — just make sure you have a body of
work built up to share with potential clients. Even if you create a few sample
pieces to have on hand, they’ll help exhibit your work and attract new
business.

To become a freelance writer, it’s essential to choose a specialty. For
instance, you might choose to only write for publications in the healthcare
industry (maybe because you were previously a healthcare worker), or focus on
lifestyle publications. Whatever the case, specializing will help you find
your niche market and gain
confidence as a new freelancer writer.

There are no educational requirements to freelance writing, but you do need
strong writing skills. It also helps to enjoy writing. While a certification
may beneficial, getting practice and writing every day is more important. Try
these writing prompts to start.

### 11\. Landscaper

Mowing, tree-trimming, and seasonal decor are all neighborhood needs. If you
have or can acquire the equipment, a landscaping business can be a lucrative
affair. It’s also a great choice if you enjoy doing it for your own home and
have a good eye for landscape design.

The good news is that you can start small. For instance, you could offer your
neighbors seasonal planting services and start with a few perennial plants, or
simply offer mulching services.

To grow your landscaping business, you should consider taking some formal
training. The following organizations offer courses:

  * CCAC
  * New York Botanical Gardens 
  * USGBC-LA

After completing a course and getting enough experience, you can apply for a
certificate from a landscaping organization. While a certificate isn’t
necessary to work in the field, it can build your credentials and help you
make industry connections to take your landscaping business to the next level.
The Association of Professional Landscape
Designers offers one potential
certificate you could pursue.

Some states require licensure, especially if you’ll be using pesticides and
fertilizers. Be sure to review the
requirements for your state.

Learn some of the basics now with this video on landscape design from Lowe’s:

### 12\. Videographer

Video production requires you to have invested in the equipment up front,
which can be quite expensive. But that’s also what makes your services so
valuable. Make sure you have a reel of your work to share or create a website
with several selections of your work available for interested viewers.

There are no educational or licensure requirements for starting a video
production business. As with writing and other creative arts, though, it pays
to specialize. Real estate videos differ radically from wedding videos, and wedding videos differ
radically from in-studio interviews and testimonials. By specializing, you
target a highly specific customer who’ll benefit the most from your services,
and you can also skill-up more effectively in one shooting style.

While you can find general classes on videography, you should consider taking
a class in the type of videography you’d like to do. For instance, you could
take The Complete Wedding Videography
Course, if that’s
the route you’d like to take.

Marketing and

### 13\. Photographer

Start by conducting photo shoots for your family and friends. As you build a
body of work, ask for referrals and reviews. Photography businesses often grow
by word of mouth, so create a Facebook page where you can tag recent clients.
Photos where you tag those clients will show up in their friends’ newsfeeds,
where they can view your work. You can also ask them to leave reviews on your
Facebook business page.

Like with a video production small business, you’ll want to specialize. Will
you do product shoots or portraits? How about wedding or fashion photo shoots?
Once you specialize, you’ll be able to create a body of work that most
accurately represents your strengths.

There are no educational or licensure requirements for starting a small
photography business, but we recommend investing in a few photography courses,
especially if you haven’t used your camera in a while. Some courses you might
start with include:

  * Cornell’s Digital Photography Certificate Program
  * New York Institute of Photography’s Course

From there, seek courses that help you build skills in your chosen specialty.

Erica Clayton’s journey into the business below. Her advice? Give yourself a
firm deadline to turn a profit.

### 14\. Bed and Breakfast Owner

!small business idea example: bed and breakfast

_Image Source_

This is another business venture that will require you to research the correct
licensure from your state, but it will be well worth it to see your dreams
come true. Consider what guests will be traveling to your area and create
special packages and themed stays that coincide with their interests in your
locale.

To start a bed and breakfast business, you’ll need a physical business
location and a small staff for maintenance, customer service, and upkeep. For
that reason, we recommend it if you have startup funds to start your business.
(Don’t have any? Here’s how to start crowdfunding to launch your new
business.)

A successful bed and breakfast business will also need an SEO-optimized
website with a hotel booking system.
If you create your website on the WordPress platform, you can easily create a
B&B website using a hotel booking
plugin — so there’s no need to code the booking form from scratch.

With Airbnb and hotels stealing market share, the competition is tough in the
bed and breakfast space, so we recommend providing a unique angle to the stay.
As mentioned, the stays can be themed — maybe your B&B is a vintage home with
all original furniture, or maybe you offer traditional fare from your
homeland.

### 15\. Clothing Boutique Owner

If you dream of building your own fashion empire, why not start with a local
boutique? Build buzz with impressive clothing styles, inspiring social media
accounts, and heavy community involvement. While you can open a physical
store, you can easily start online — and if that proves profitable, you can
open up a local shop.

There are a few ways you can start a clothing boutique. First, you can make
the clothes yourself if you already have experience in fashion design or know
how to sew, knit, and curate colors and patterns.

Alternatively, you can design certain aspects of the clothing — such as a
graphic or a logo — then send it to be printed on-demand at a local print shop
when orders come in.

Lastly, you can dropship the
items from a warehouse you’ve partnered with. This method is less reliable
because there’s less quality assurance for each item, especially if you never
visit the warehouses yourself. Regardless of the method you choose, starting a
clothing boutique is highly doable, and you don’t need to have a fashion
degree (though it certainly helps).

Take some inspiration from Sleep
Ova, a luxury
loungewear boutique based in Los Angeles, CA.

### 16\. Specialty Food Store Owner

!small business idea example: specialty food
store

Image Source

Gourmet foods, cheeses, sake, wine — you name a food, there’s a specialty food
store out there for it. Put your passion for exotic olive oils to good use and
open a store like American Provisions
where you offer the kind of expertise and selection your audience couldn’t
dream of getting from their local grocer.

To start your specialty food store, you’ll want to curate and source the items
from makers that you love and trust. Ask around your community to find local
makers of the food you want to sell, and the makers will likely be open to a
partnership, especially if they get a cut of the profits.

When it’s time to sell, you’ll want to find a physical location, but if that
investment is too high, you can start by setting up stalls at food festivals
and local markets. Or you can go the ecommerce
route and sell the products
through your website, taking care to carefully pack perishable items.

### 17\. Food Truck Owner

Always dreamt of owning a restaurant but not quite ready to take the plunge?
Test out your concepts with a food truck. It’s a great way to become familiar
with food and restaurant licensing in your state, see what people like and
don’t like, and build a ravenous following before ever opening or investing in
a brick-and-mortar location.

Food trucks will require a larger investment, but thankfully, you can rent the
truck itself — the Food Truck Group and Roaming
Hunger are two
potential leasers you could look at. The cost will be high, so we recommend
renting one in preparation for an event such as a food festival or concert.
There, you’ll get to test out the popularity of your cuisine and see if the
food truck business is right for you.

Taco Nganas, a taco truck in
Memphis, TN, started with one food truck and expanded to three, building a
loyal customer base along the way.

### 18\. Car-detailing Specialist

!small business idea example: car detailing

Image Source

The devil is in the details, and you can be too. Car-detailing services that
travel to the client are convenient for busy people who can’t find the time to
run through the car wash. With this business, your clients only have to pay
and the service will be done for them before they know it. Just make sure you
have the flexibility, transportation, and equipment to take your business on
the road.

There are no educational requirements for car detailing, but you should still
take a course such as Auto Finesse’s detailing
training to learn core concepts and
brush up on your skills.

To get your car detailing business off the ground, you’ll need an SEO-
optimized website and a way for customers to book online with you. Before you
take that step, however, consider listing your services on websites like
Angi, Thumbtack, and
even Nextdoor.com so you can get your first local
clients.

## Best Businesses to Start with Little Money

Don’t have a lot of money to start your business? Check out the ideas below.

### 1\. Translator

Speak a foreign language? Start a translation service. Consider specializing
in a specific genre of translation, like medical or financial translation, as
you might be able to fill a niche need in your community.

!small business ideas: translator

Image Source

To become a translator, you should have a rock-solid grasp of two languages —
ideally, you’ll be near native level for both. You don’t need special
credentials to become a translator, but a certification (such as from the
American Translators Association)
will legitimize your business and help you get clients.

Prior to gaining a certification, you can also pursue an online certificate,
which will teach you the basics of translation. Some providers include:

  * University of Massachusetts Amherst
  * The University of Arizona 
  * University of Georgia

### 2\. Garden Designer

Many people have the willingness to do the dirty work in their backyards, but
few have the know-how to complete the first part of this process — designing
and planning the backyard space. Draw up the designs for your clients’ outdoor
spaces and let them do the actual digging.

But you can also offer installation services, or hire your own contractors to
fulfill the design.

!small business ideas: garden designer

Image Source 

To become a garden designer, you should seek at least one credential so you’re
well-versed in the basics and prevent damage to a client’s landscape. The
American Academy of Garden
Design offers courses and
certificates that start at $450. A cheaper option is New Skills Academy’s
Garden Design Certification ($120).

Remember, the goal is to start a business for cheap, and a certification can
have a high ROI after you book your first few clients for garden design.

### 3\. Travel Planner

The time of the travel agent might be passing, but people are still looking
for those with a knack for more nontraditional travel coordination. If you
always plan the perfect vacations complete with beautiful hotels, the ideal
location, and a bevy of delicious restaurants lined up for every evening,
consider advertising your services as a more modern approach to travel
planning.

You don’t have to only plan trips for individuals, either. If you’re
experienced enough, you can even start a group travel company, like Art N
Soul Escapes.

You can become a travel planner by first volunteering to plan a few trips for
your family and friends. Try it and see if you like it. Once you feel like
you’ve gotten a good taste, attend a travel planner program and get certified.
Some options include:

  * The Travel Institute Training & Certification Program
  * Penn Foster Travel and Tourism Specialist Diploma

You can also seek employment at a travel agency first, then strike out on your
own once you’ve learned the basics.

### 4\. Home Inspector

A home inspector examines a house’s drywall, electrical wiring, energy
efficiency, and structural integrity to find potential issues on behalf of a
home buyer. Home inspectors work in the field. They visit homes in person and
provide a written inspection report. Alternatively, some home inspectors offer
virtual inspections, which may be a good fit if you’d prefer to work from
home.

!small business ideas: home inspector

Image Source

Working as a home inspector requires certification and a great deal of
expertise, but it can offer a flexible work schedule and stable income.
Confirm the licensing requirements in your state before getting started with
this type of small business. You’ll want to make sure you’re providing the
best service to your clients by having all of your credentials in order.

To become a home inspector, you should invest in a certification program, such
as:

  * International Association of Certified Home Inspectors 
  * ATI Home Inspector Academy

Be sure to check local authorities and universities for a course.

### 5\. Personal Chef

We all love to eat, but few of us have the time or energy to cook healthy,
delicious meals. Advertise your services to local families and businesses
alike. To save on start-up costs, consider scheduling certain groups of
clients together — say, vegetarians — so you can cook larger quantities of the
same dish.

You can also begin by selling food in batches at local farmer’s markets or via
a food truck. Once you’ve generated some awareness, you can begin taking on
clients. Alternatively, you can start a delivery meal prep service by cooking
5-7 days’ worth of meals for clients.

!small business idea example: personal chef

Image Source

Chef Paul’s mouth-watering dishes are
available to clients across the country. His clientele niche consists of
athletes, corporate businesses, and local gyms.

### 6\. Property Manager

Many people maintain properties they don’t live in — often based in different
cities or states. As a property manager, you can help a property owner ensure
their home is well taken care of, handle small fixes as they arise, and serve
as a liaison to renters. It’s helpful if you have a background in real estate.

This option is a great fit if you have stupendous organizational,
administrative, and customer service skills. As a property manager, you’ll be
handling everything from screening potential tenants to collecting rent.

To become a property manager, you must first complete coursework in your
desired state. We recommend working at an existing property management company
to get your foot in the door. Once you’ve learned the basics, you can then
start your own property management business.

### 7\. Massage Therapist

Soothe aching muscles and promote peace for your clients as a massage
therapist. As a massage therapist, you’ll offer targeted, personalized care
that’s an edge above in-shop or mall massage services. To start this small
business, you should invest in customer service courses, as well as a massage
therapy certification.

Be sure to look into training and certification courses in your city and
state, and to invest in a portable bed to take on client visits.

### 8\. Interior Designer

Similar to landscape design — there are many people who have the ability to
buy the furniture and home decor they need to fill their rooms, but few who
know where to start. It might take some time to build a portfolio, but
documenting your projects and sharing them online can build a fanbase beyond
your wildest dreams.

To start an interior design business, we first recommend trying your hand at
decorating your friends’ homes and working with their vision and
specifications. One big aspect of interior design is providing fantastic
customer service and knowing how to fulfill a client’s design vision while
employing your interior design expertise.

You can then take an interior design course to round out your knowledge, such
as the one offered by The New York Institute of Art and
Design.

Cavallo’s interior design Instagram

### 9\. Nonprofit Owner

If you dream of devoting your life to a cause you believe in, it might be time
to start a nonprofit. You’ll need to incorporate your business and file for
501(c)(3) tax-exempt status — and then you’ll be required to meet ongoing
standards of compliance, but the payoff is making a meaningful impact on a
cause you believe in.

The best thing is that you can begin a nonprofit easily from your home, even
before filing for 501(c)(3) status. First, create a non-profit
website
(ideally with a .org top-level-domain). Define your mission and goals, and
figure out how you’ll execute your non-profit activities. For instance, if
you’re raising money to buy books for local schools, who will deliver them?
Which retailer will you use? Start small, then expand.

Thereafter, apply for exempt status so that you’re not taxed like a regular
business. The profit margins may be smaller, but the job is endlessly
rewarding.

### 10\. Tutor

Whether you’re a math whiz, piano master, or Shakespeare aficionado, there’s
someone out there who needs a little help in your area of expertise and is
willing to pay for it. Advertise your services through local schools,
community colleges, community centers, and even social media to get the word
out and build a customer base.

To start a tutoring business, you should first gain experience educating
others by either volunteering or even teaching friends and family. But you can
begin straight away by listing your services locally and online and launching
a tutoring website.

Be sure to define your niche. Will you be tutoring students in their homes? Or
opening a local tutoring location? Which subject will you teach? Create
handouts, use textbooks, and know which online resources will be best for your
tutee’s learning style.

### 11\. Consultant

If you have significant experience in or knowledge of a specific subject,
consider becoming a consultant. Perhaps you’re an expert at hiring practices,
have a knack for
SEO, or have led multiple sales teams to six-
figure success. Identify your expertise and market yourself as a consultant
and charge the going rate.

redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/53/02ad083b-4b9a-4d8c-b5ef-5df2577993a5)

Some consulting industries are more competitive than others, so be sure to
complete your research prior to starting a small consulting business. One way
to find out how competitive a consulting niche is by doing keyword
search. If
your target niche is highly searched or already is dominated by big companies,
you may have a harder time breaking in. You can use keyword research
tools to uncover keyword volume and local
demand.

### 12\. Event Planner

An event planning business is an excellent choice if you have great
organizational and interpersonal skills, and it’s relatively cheap to start.
You might choose to specialize in a specific type of event — like weddings or
company meetings — or set yourself up as an event planner of all trades.

The good news is that event planners are always in demand. It’s not a job that
can be easily automated, so this small business idea is set to thrive
regardless of the digital landscape. To start, you’ll want to look for a
platform that will easily allow you to advertise your availability, such as
event planner directories like
Eventective and
WeddingWire.

If you’re highly organized, are detail-oriented, and have experience planning
large events, it might be time for others to benefit from your skills.

### 13\. Personal Assistant

Personal assistants help business owners and executives take care of
administrative tasks. To launch a freelance personal assistant business, you
should leverage networking opportunities on
LinkedIn and attend small
business events at local chambers of commerce. Most local business owners
might not even know they need a personal assistant until you market your
services to them.

If you’re an organized, highly-detailed person, the life of a personal
assistant might be for you. Don’t want to be tied to one office or person all
day, every day? Consider becoming a virtual assistant, which allows you a more
flexible work environment.

To become an assistant, choose a niche — will you be helping women business
owners specifically? Do you have a specific field of expertise, like
bookkeeping? A website can also go a long way, and be sure to print business
cards for you to hand out during networking events.

### 14\. Consignment Shop Owner

If you have an eye for style but don’t want to invest in the inventory of a
brand-new boutique, consider starting a consignment shop. It will allow you to
curate a collection of clothing that matches your goals and aesthetic, without
the overhead of a boutique selling entirely new garments.

The beauty of a small consignment business is that you can now start one
online. You can sign up on a platform such as
Poshmark, Depop, and even
Etsy, then easily start selling your own used fashion
from home.

Once you’ve defined your niche — such as vintage clothing, unique locally made
art, or colorful shoes — you can begin sourcing new products from your local
stores and thrift shops.

### 15\. Caterer

If the personal chef gig is too restrictive for your schedule, consider
catering instead. Pick your projects, work on fewer but larger events, and
hone in on your time management skills.

Becoming a caterer is a natural step for those who are used to cooking for
large events — for instance, you may have already catered your friend’s
wedding, or brought a 20-person meal to a potluck (that counts, too!).

It’s essential that you have enough temperature-regulated storage for the
meals prior to each event, and that you arrange for reliable, temperature-
controlled transportation to and from your home kitchen. Alternatively, you
can lower your costs by inviting customers to pick up their order at your
home.

### 16\. Gym Owner

Kickboxing gyms, yoga studios, CrossFit, oh my! Turn your passion for fitness
into a community for others by creating your own gym — start one from the
ground up, become an affiliate, or open a franchise location.

Available franchise opportunities include Anytime Fitness, Orangetheory
Fitness, Pure Barre, Planet Fitness, Crunch Fitness, and more. Be prepared to
take out a loan to finance your franchise — most agreements start with fees
upward of $20,000. But the payoff can be tremendous due to brand recognition.
You’ll have no trouble recruiting new members as long as you use local
marketing strategies.

Alternatively, you can create a local studio, but ideally, it should be for a
specific activity instead of general fitness. Yoga, pilates, bootcamp-style
gyms, and martial arts perform well as independent fitness studios.

### 17\. Boutique Agency Owner

What’s your specialty? Whether it’s marketing, social media, or PR, it might
be time to start your own agency. Many other small businesses need this type
of help but don’t have the resources or volume to necessitate a full-time
position.

To start an agency, you would ideally have worked in your specialty for a
number of years. You should also be prepared to interface directly with
clients, fulfill their requirements, and temper their expectations (if they
want results in an unreasonably short amount of time).

Consider building a small team and learn from other entrepreneurs who’ve
successfully started their own agencies, like Duane Brown of Take Some
Risk.

### 18\. Coffee Shop Owner

Turn your caffeine addiction into something a little more lucrative. Opening a
franchise or buying an existing shop are lower-risk entry points to the coffee
game, but they usually require a little more cash upfront. Starting a
shop from scratch requires more planning and work — but it also
maximizes your earning potential in the future.

A coffee shop is an excellent fit if you already have a full-time remote job
and wish to supplement your income with a small business. You can manage the
coffee shop as you work at one of the tables, but be sure to have the budget
to hire an experienced barista who can pick up the slack.

If you would like to open a coffee shop and run it full-time on your own,
you’ll need to undertake barista training, understand worldwide coffee
sources, and have excellent customer service skills.

### 19\. Moving Company

A truck, moving equipment, manpower, and the correct permits and insurance are
the building blocks of starting your own moving
company.
Before you buy your first fleet of trucks, however, start small with a moving
van and keep your costs low.

Still sound like too much of an initial investment? Consider offering packing
services only, which have a much lower financial barrier to entry. You can
partner with moving companies and offer to do their packing, or have them
refer clients to you.

You could even take a niche approach to the industry as Astro
International has by offering international moving
services.

### 20\. Home Staging

If you have a flair for interior design, a staging
service might
serve as your creative outlet and professional calling. You can build a
portfolio with little initial investment by staging homes using the owner’s
existing furnishings and decor. Most stagers eventually build up an inventory
of furniture as they become more established and network with area realtors.

To get your first home staging clients, you should first rely exclusively on
networking. Find your local realtors’ association and attend their events with
business cards handy. Once you’ve gotten your first clients and built your
portfolio, you can begin posting your designs on your home staging website.

!small business ideas: home staging

If you don’t yet have enough experience, be sure to pursue an interior design
course before opening this small business.

## Home Business Ideas

These home business ideas give you a few more business options that are either
based at home or online.

### 1\. Coding

Frontend, backend, and every type of code in between, this skill requires no
in-person interaction with your clients. But one skill you’ll want to carry
over from the in-person world for this type of business is active listening.
It can be easy to zone out while building a product, but developing a
connection with the client is just as important as developing the code for
their website.

If you keep the client top of mind when you can’t be around physically, you
can ensure that you’re meeting their development needs with your coding work.

### 2\. Vending Machine Owner

Since 2015, the growth rate for vending machine
businesses has increased 1.4%. Even as
social distancing restrictions are still in place, this business can still be
lucrative if you choose the right locations. High-traffic is key — places like
hospitals, schools, and community centers are smart places to start placing
your machines to generate enough revenue to cover cost and turn a profit.

!small business idea example: vending machine

### 3\. Social Media Manager

Do you have a knack for social media? As a social media manager, you can use
your skills to manage the social media accounts for companies and even
individual people. Influencer marketing has become more common and many
influencers rely on marketing agencies or employees to help them run their
social channels.

redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/53/3e56e15d-47bd-46c9-a256-99fde52abfe7)

### 4\. Data Entry Clerk

Many businesses seek data entry clerks to help them enter information into
their computer systems and spreadsheets. If you have strong computer and
typing skills, this might be the business for you.

### 5\. Audio or Video Editor

As of March 2021, there are 1.75 million
podcasts available to
listeners. For this reason, brands are turning to audio and visual
content to connect
with consumers. The catch is that many don't have the time to invest in the
production of this content, or they don't have the skills to do it. Audio and
video editors are in demand when it comes to producing quality content for
hungry audiences.

### 6\. Voiceover Artist

Speaking of podcasts and videos, many content creators recognize the value and
level of professionalism that great voice talent can bring to a project. There
are gigs out there for podcast intros/outros, narration for explainer videos,
or even voice work for audiobooks. Learn how to get started with no experience
from Kat Theo below:

### 7\. Dog Walker, Groomer, or Trainer

Licensing and insurance will be the two most important factors
in opening a dog walking, grooming, or training business, but your canine
colleagues will surely make up for the initial red tape. To test the waters
before jumping in, consider walking dogs through companies like Rover. Ready
to run your own show? Consider a franchise like
Dogtopia.

### 8\. Candy Seller

If you grew up in a close-knit, southern neighborhood, you're probably
familiar with the "Candy Lady". This home business can be started by anyone who's
trustworthy in the community. Aside from selling the most popular snacks, a
candy seller can provide the neighborhood with fresh fruit and produce that
may be harder to find if you live in a food desert.

## Online Business Ideas

If you want a business idea that you can run entirely online, check out the
ones below. These ideas are ideal for those looking for a passive income
stream. In other words, you shouldn’t need to do too much manual work to
launch these businesses from your home or preferred business location.

### 1\. Become an online reseller.

To become an online reseller, all you need is some business savvy and some
funds to invest in product stock from manufacturers — or, of course,the
willingness to sell your own used items. Generally, this is a low-touch but
high-performance way of creating a passive income online business.

Online resellers usually use a platform, such as Facebook Marketplace or
Amazon Sellers, to sell either their own or manufacturers’ stock. The benefit
of using Facebook Marketplace is that
you can begin today with your own Facebook account, and simply list items that
you already own.

Interested buyers typically drive directly to your home for pick-up — but if
you’re not interested in human interaction, you can leave it outside and have
the buyer pay via an online platform.

!online business ideas: amazon seller

Amazon Sellers requires a little more up-front
investment, but the yield is usually higher and you can turn your Amazon
reselling business into a more passive income stream. Amazon allows you to buy
stock from various manufacturers, which they then keep in their warehouses.
When an Amazon user buys from you, Amazon will fulfill that order and then
give you a substantial cut.

### 2\. Try affiliate marketing.

An affiliate marketing business is a great fit if you already own a website or a blog you
wish to monetize. We’ve already shared how blogging is a great business to
start — if you’ve already bought a domain name and begun writing content, then
using it to start your affiliate marketing business is a great option.

Affiliate marketers create blog posts and content that contain affiliate
links. When a user clicks on that link, a cookie is added to their browser
that tracks their activity for a specified period of time. If they make a
purchase at the affiliate website, then you get a commission — usually
recurring, if you’re selling subscription products.

There are countless affiliate marketing
programs for you
to start your online business. These programs come with many benefits, such as
pre-made advertisements and lazy copy for you to use.

To create a viable affiliate marketing online business, you should choose the
right blog niche, such
as technology, household decor and organization, or fitness, and then find
affiliate marketing programs that offer products your readership would be
genuinely interested in.

### 3\. Become a content creator or influencer.

Instagrammers, YouTubers, podcasters, and TikTokkers with more than ten
thousand followers can eventually turn their accounts into a small online
business that generates passive income.

As a content creator or influencer on social media, you can not only earn
money from sponsored partnerships, but you can monetize your audience in other
ways, such as creating Subscriptions on
Instagram, allowing companies to
advertise on your YouTube channel, or creating a paid-only newsletter.

!online business ideas: content creator

Becoming an influencer or content creator takes hard work, but it can be a fun
way to create a small online business, assuming you’re posting content that
you enjoy creating. First, you should choose a niche, such as thrifted
fashion, work-from-home hacks, or even industry tips. Then, you should learn
how to become a social media
influencer and digital creator, then create a social media content
calendar.

Most importantly, have fun with this online business idea as you give it a
try. The good news is that it has little overhead — all you need is a
willingness to spend time on social media content creation.

### 4\. Open a dropshipping store.

We’ve mentioned
dropshipping a few times already, but this is such a great online business
idea that it’s absolutely worth mentioning again. Dropshipping businesses
don’t manufacture what they sell, or even buy stock from manufacturers in
advance. Instead, wholesalers fulfill the order directly after a buyer places
an order through your website.

Opening an ecommerce store can be forbidding for those who don’t want to deal
with inventory management or supply chain logistics. Dropshipping is the best alternative.

The only thing you need is the willingness to invest in an ecommerce website
builder and the ability
to manage relationships with local or international manufacturers. From there,
you need to only publish your site and advertise your brand via ecommerce
marketing.

Learn how to start a dropshipping business
here, with examples.

### 5\. Sell print-on-demand products.

Print-on-demand (POD) is
another way to start a dropshipping business, except it’s a little more
frictionless because most POD services allow you to create a storefront right on their website,
instead of you needing to look for a separate ecommerce site builder.

With a POD online business, you design unique artwork. The print-on-demand
provider will allow you to place that design on t-shirts, hats, tote bags,
phone cases, and more. You do not keep any inventory; instead, the POD
provider will print it only after a buyer makes an order, then ships it
directly to them.

!online business ideas: print on demand shop

The only thing you need to start this small online business is a penchant for
design and the budget to pay for a print-on-demand subscription (although most
providers are free, and they simply take a cut of the sale). Get acquainted
with design principles and color
theory, and you can
get started with this business in no time.

### 6\. Become an independent author.

Think becoming an author is only for those who are extremely lucky? Think
again. Whether you write historical epics or self-help guides, chances are
that there’s a market to read your work, and you can now easily publish it
online.

We recommend editing and proofreading your book, or hiring someone to do it,
before self-publishing it. Then, it’s as simple as signing up on a self-
publishing platform such as Kindle Direct
Publishing or Barnes & Noble
Press, uploading your file and cover, and
pushing it live. You’ll enjoy benefits such as large royalties (up to 70%) and
the ability to unpublish the book at any time, in case you find a typo or
another change you’d like to make.

To get this online business idea off to a strong start, invest in an author
website, spend some time
doing social media marketing, and learn the basics of book
marketing.

### 7\. Sell downloadable digital products.

Downloadable journals, templates, art prints, designs… Some people would
simply prefer to print these at home, instead of paying for the full price of
the paper and the design. Downloadable digital products can be a profitable
small business idea for those who are already design-savvy or who are willing
to learn how to use an online design
tool.

!online business ideas: digital products

Image Source

But if you’re not too crafty, you don’t need to create full-on journals or
beautiful art prints, either; you can create templates for marketplaces such
as Canva’s. There, people are able to
customize a base design to their specifications, so you don’t have to worry
too much about creating something specially beautiful — it’s more about
functionality and customizability.

If you plan to create digital products that buyers can print at home, think
about printing specifications, such as recommended paper size, paper weight,
PPI (pixels per inch; a higher PPI results in better print quality), and so
on. It’s essential to create a positive customer experience, even if users are
ultimately responsible for what the final result looks like.

### 8\. Publish a subscription-based newsletter.

We’ve already discussed becoming an independent author, but if long-form
writing, such as novels, seems out of reach, you can always go for something
much shorter and simpler: Newsletters. And the best part about paid
newsletters is that you typically don’t need to have a separate website and
blog; instead, you can sign up on a platform and begin publishing right away.

A website can, of course, benefit you, but the core of your revenue will come
from the newsletter itself.

!online business ideas: paid newsletter

Image Source

With newsletter monetization platforms such as
Substack or even Patreon,
you can publish shorter content that features your opinion, experience, and
expertise. We recommend pairing this small business idea with a robust social
media marketing strategy, where your followers can learn more about you and
be swayed to subscribe to a gated newsletter.

Choose a niche you’re passionate about, and this online business idea can feel
less like work and more like a profitable hobby.

### 9\. Create an online course.

If you want to monetize your expertise a little further for your online
business, then creating an online course is the best choice.

To create a course, you’ll need to sign up on an online course platform such
as WordPress or Teachable, sketch out a curriculum, film your lectures, and create worksheets
and guides. You can be as hands-on or as hands-off as you’d like, but to make
this online business as passive as possible, you’d ideally record all your
lectures at once and allow users to access them by paying a premium fee.

If you’d like to try your hand at it first, you can try publishing a course on
a platform such as Udemy and see if it feels
viable to you. To become an online course teacher, you don’t need a specific
level of education, but you should have a strong grasp on the material you’re
teaching and a strong set of customer service
skills to handle
inquiries or course refunds.

### 10\. Transcript videos, shows, and podcasts.

A freelance transcription business is an excellent idea for those who speak
only one language and are passionate about improving communication.
Transcribers listen to speech, write it out — usually verbatim — and deliver
it to the original publisher in an organized document.

This small online business is a good fit for those who are looking for a part-
time side business. You should be able to type quickly and have a good
listening ear. Indeed has listed the top transcription
companies where you can get your foot in the door.

Once you understand how the industry works, you can consider opening your own
small transcription business and offering services on freelancer marketplaces
such as Fiverr or Upwork.

## Easy Businesses to Start

Whether you’re looking to start your venture today or you simply don’t want to
jump through the normal hoops of launching a small business, the below ideas
are extremely easy to start — so easy, all you’ll need to do is sign up on a
website or tell your friends about your services.

### 1\. Vacation Host

Have you ever used a home-sharing service instead of a hotel? You could make a
living by hosting visitors in your own home or renting out a room. Consider
becoming a host with companies like
Airbnb.

To become a vacation host, you don’t need any special skills except
friendliness, courteousness, and agility (in case of guest emergencies or
language barriers). A customer service
course
will prepare you to welcome guests and give them a pleasant stay.

You’ll need to invest in supplies and toiletries, such as new bedding and one-
time soaps and toothbrushes, but the overhead is relatively small, and you can
stop at any time.

### 2\. Pet Sitter

Do you have a passion for pets? Consider becoming a pet sitter. While the
pet's owners are away on vacation, either host their pet at your home or make
visits to their home. Join a pet sitting service like
Wag to get started.

!small business idea example: pet sitter

_Image Source_

If you start a pet sitting business, be sure to have some experience with
dogs, cats, and other household pets. You should also choose a niche based on
timing. For instance, do you prefer long-term arrangements? You can market
yourself as an excellent vacation pet sitter. Do you only do single
afternoons, or only on weekends? You can pull in clients by telling them
you’ll take care of their pets during their dates or weekend trips.

### 3\. Daycare Owner

Childcare continues to be in high demand. While nannies and nanny shares are
popular right now, a good daycare is hard to find. Fill a need in your
neighborhood by opening your own. And, as always, make sure you’re complying
with your city and state’s zoning, licensure, insurance, and inspection
requirements.

Home daycares are especially a good fit if you’re an experienced parent and
have all supplies ready at home. But be warned that you’ll also need to buy
more supplies to accommodate the additional children you’ll need to take care
of.

We recommend getting a soft start with this business by advertising it first
to your friends, families, and close neighbors. That way, you can better gauge
whether it’s a good fit for you and whether you want to make the full
investment.

### 4\. Blogger

If there’s a topic you have a heavy interest in, then there’s an audience out
there with a heavy interest in it too. A
blog can be used to build an online community
whose engagement can be monetized. Affiliate
marketing, sponsored
content, and co-
marketing are some ways to make money once
your blog develops a following.

redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/53/ccc95db5-9007-49cf-b69c-94bb5c46b366)

Blogging is one of the most accessible small businesses to start, and there
are countless niches to
choose from. That said, because there are many blogs online, you’ll need to
learn blog SEO and keyword research to ensure your audience finds you. That way, you
actually make money out of your blogging efforts.

The great news is that a small blogging business has a ridiculously low
overhead. All you need is a custom domain and your time for writing blog
posts.

### 5\. Home-Baked Goods Seller

Warehouse-made, store-bought chocolate chip cookies will never compare to a
batch made with love in someone’s home. Simple desserts can be easily baked
and packaged to sell at local events or around your neighborhood. Use custom
labels and watch the word spread about your goods!

You can begin a baked goods business easily by opening a Facebook and
Instagram profile. Facebook and Instagram are both excellent platforms to
market your goods, show pictures of your previous baked products, and even
showcase happy clients.

Build a loyal following slowly, and save on costs by asking clients to drive
to your home to pick up their order. Choosing a niche can be helpful here, or
baking in a specific style that can’t be found at grocery store bakeries. The
overhead can be especially low if you already have most essential baking
supplies.

### 6\. Ecommerce Store Owner

Do you create, collect, or curate anything special? Consider starting an
ecommerce store and turning your hobby into a
full-time job. Whether you need somewhere to sell all that pottery you’ve been
making, or an excuse to search for the sports memorabilia you love tracking
down, an ecommerce store can make it financially viable for you to pursue your
passion.

Starting an ecommerce store is simple and easy. You can set up a shop using an
ecommerce website builder, all of which start at a minimal monthly subscription (some even
start at free). Be sure to take good photos of your products and write
descriptive product pages.

If you don’t have inventory, you can always own an ecommerce store by using
dropshipping. Instead of creating and shipping your products yourself,
you’ll instead partner with a dropshipping website and have them mail out the
orders directly to your client.

### 7\. House Cleaner

With a low barrier to entry, house cleaning can be a great way to start doing
what you love — soon. Consider advertising to homes in your neighborhood and
get more bang for your buck by earning a few small businesses as clients as
well. They’ll usually bring in a higher paycheck for a similar amount of work.

To become a house cleaner, you should be prepared to invest in cleaning
supplies and accessories, or be willing to use your own. If you plan to serve
small businesses, you should buy industrial janitorial
supplies so you can get
work done more effectively.

Need some inspiration? This small business cleaning
service grew virtually overnight on Instagram
after their content went viral during the pandemic.

### 8\. Packing Services Facilitator

Moving is always a pain, and many people hire the entire packing process out.
As a packing services facilitator, you’ll be going to people’s homes and
packing up their smaller items into organized boxes. To start this business,
you must be comfortable with face-to-face contact and with manual labor.

You can begin this business by advertising in your own neighborhood. Once
you’re ready to expand, consider partnering with a local moving service that
will refer new clients to you. That way, you’ll have a steady stream of
clients, and you won’t have to invest in a moving truck (the moving service
will take care of that for you).

## Business Ideas for Students

### 1\. Etsy Shop Owner

Creating novelties by hand is a fun and unique way to start a small business,
and you can easily sell them via Etsy. Whether you
make jewelry, knitted comfort items, or even custom
wigs, there’s probably a market for your products
and an Etsy buyer who’s ready to purchase.

!small business ideas: etsy shop owner

This idea is excellent if you’re already an expert in the craft you aim to
sell. That way, you don’t need to pursue additional education or certification
courses. Once you set up your Etsy store, which is free, tap into your
audience with creative marketing on social media and optimize your website
using keywords that describe the products you make.

### 2\. Tour Guide

Love the local history of your city or state? Consider becoming a tour guide.
Sure, you’ll need to conduct plenty of research to be able to do the job well,
but that’s half the fun. Set yourself apart by offering tours that speak to a
specific niche of your community’s history.

You can start a tour guide business easily. First, decide what your specialty
will be. Some tour guides, like the ones at Freedom Trail in
Boston, offer historical walking tours of
their town’s most haunted spots while others curate guided foodie tours for
guests to get a true taste of the city.

sightseeing-royalty-free-image/73213136?adppopup=true)

Maybe you love the outdoors and are an experienced backpacker — you can then
offer hiking tours. To begin, use a platform such as TripAdvisor or Airbnb,
where you can sign up as a tour guide provider. Remember to launch a website,
and to file for sole proprietorship
status.

### 3\. Online Class Instructor

Tutoring is often done in person and with one client at a time. Remotely
teaching an online class offers more flexibility because you can teach
multiple students from home. English is a common subject for online classes
because of how many people want to learn it. But anything that you have a
mastery over could be translated to a virtual class.

### 4\. Small-Batch Goods Seller

Using organic, all-natural ingredients is more expensive, but worth it. There
are many products you can learn how to make at home without any preservatives,
chemicals, or toxins. Candles, soaps, shampoos, and moisturizers are some
examples of goods you can create and tailor with custom scents. Try starting
out making soap with this complete beginner’s guide to soapmaking:

### 5\. Makeup Artist

Many people prefer to have a professional do their makeup because they may
lack the proper products or just the skills. It may be for a special occasion,
photoshoot, or video shoot, or another event. Being able to do a variety of
different looks will make your business more attractive to more customers.

To run a successful makeup artist business, you’ll need to be social media
savvy.
Instagram
in particular is an excellent platform to advertise your services and get new
clients.

You should also consider honing in on a specific niche. For instance, you
might do wedding makeup exclusively.

### 6\. Professional Organizer

A lot of people struggle with clutter or disorganization in their homes and
offices. It can be a large undertaking to create organized systems and habits.
Grab a lot of storage bins and a label maker and get started!

To become an organizer, you’ll first need to have the chops: Is your own home
organized? Do you enjoy making order out of chaos? Then, launch a
website to
market your services locally. Be sure to create local listings to ensure
people find your business, including listings on Angi, Houzz, and Thumbtack.

Is your head buzzing with small business ideas yet? After all that
brainstorming, you’ll need a practical plan to get started with your new small
business.

## How to Start a Small Business at Home

  1. Identify your small business idea.
  2. Start as a side business or hobby.
  3. Decide on your software.
  4. Create a business plan.
  5. Decide whether you'll be an LLC or sole proprietorship.
  6. Create a business bank account.
  7. Determine if your business idea works well from home.
  8. Set up an office.
  9. Get to work!

### 1\. Identify your small business idea.

Whether you choose an option from the list above or have another idea up your
sleeve, it’s important to have the experience, training, or skills necessary
to be successful. Want to run a daycare but have never even visited a
successful daycare center? Spend time conducting research to learn whether
this is really the right fit for your experience, interests, and target
audience.

### 2\. Start as a side business or hobby.

Can you get your business off the ground as something you do in the evenings
or on the weekends (a.k.a. a side job)? This allows you to make some mistakes,
test the market, and understand whether your idea has legs before you quit
your nine-to-five job and lose your primary income.

### 3\. Decide on your software.

You’ve got a lot of things on your plate when first starting up. But one step
that’s critical (and often forgotten by first-time entrepreneurs) is deciding
on the software that can help you be more efficient as your business grows.

Every business is different — but almost all companies can use software to
help with analytics, project management, accounting, bookkeeping, email marketing, and other
basic day-to-day tasks.

One of the most important software tools every small business should utilize
is a free all-in-one CRM
platform to
keep track of important customer information in one central database. It will
help align your team and make sure you stay organized as your business grows.

### 4\. Create a business plan.

No business plan? No business. Particularly if your small business idea
requires investors, you'll need to draft up a business plan to provide an
overview of your market positioning, your financial projections, and your
unique competitive advantages. You can download HubSpot's free business plan
templates for free to get started.

![One-Page Business Plan Template](https://offers.hubspot.com/business-
plan-template?hubs_post-cta=image)

Download Free Business Plan Templates

Your business plan should include the following elements:

  * **Executive summary** — A high-level overview of your company and market placement.
  * **Business model** — Outline what your business does, who your business serves, and how your business is structured. You should include a description of what products and services you offer, and how they meet the needs of your customers.
  * **Market condition** — A summary of pertinent competitor information. Determine the strengths and weaknesses of your closest competitors.
  * **Products and services** — Use this section to describe your products and services in detail, and outline what differentiates your product from others in the market.
  * **Operations and management** — Outline your business’ organizational structure, key roles, and responsibilities.
  * **Marketing and sales strategy** — This section should describe how you will market and sell your product. Include information on your ideal customer, how you plan to position your offering, and your sales strategy.

  * **Financial plan** — Create a detailed outline of your business financials. Include your start-up costs, your initial financial productions, and how you anticipate generating funding.

  * **Appendix** — Once the above pieces are complete, end the document with an appendix summarizing your business plan.

### 5\. Decide whether you’ll be an LLC or sole proprietorship.

Two common legal structures for small businesses are limited liability
corporations (LLCs) and sole proprietorships.

An LLC is a more complex business structure than a sole proprietorship and can
include individuals, corporations, and other LLCs as members. Additionally,
LLCs are not subject to a separate level of tax and offer the business owner
liability protection and tax advantages. LLCs are formed on a state-by-state
basis.

Sole proprietorships are businesses owned and operated by one person and are
not identified as a separate entity from the owner by the government. While a
sole proprietorship is the simplest business structure, sole proprietors are
personally liable for their business.

Besides an LLC or sole proprietorship, there are a few other options for you
to consider.

Sean Flannigan, Sendle's Content Manager, says,
"While many small businesses might be best served by choosing an LLC or sole
proprietorship, there are a few other options."

"Partnerships are great for businesses operated by several individuals. It
hews most closely to a sole proprietorship in that the individuals take on the
business liability and pay taxes on a personal level."

He adds, "To completely avoid personal liability, small businesses might
choose to incorporate as a corporation, S corporation, or B Corp. S
corporations avoid corporate taxation whereas B Corps must meet a threshold
for public benefit and accountability."

Additionally, Flannigan says, "There are tons of great reasons to become a B
Corp beyond just doing good
business. All that said, many small businesses that aren't aimed at super-fast
growth choose to go with an LLC to keep things simple while shielding owners
from too much liability."

business from the Small Business Administration.

### 6\. Create a business bank account.

Once you have a legally formed business and have been issued an Employer
Identification Number (EIN), open a bank account specifically for your
business. Having a business bank account is essential for keeping your
personal and business finances separate which can help you gain an accurate
picture of your business’s cash flow and financial health.

Additionally, keeping your personal and business finances separate makes
bookkeeping and tax preparation easier.

Many banks offer business checking and savings accounts. Business checking
accounts typically do not have a limit on the number of transactions that can
take place, and issue a debit card that can be used for making business
purchases. However, these checking accounts do not accrue interest.

Business savings accounts typically earn interest over time but have a limited
number of transactions that can occur each month. When you’re just starting
out, look for a business bank account that does not have a minimum balance
requirement so you are not penalized for having low funds as you work to build
your business.

7\. Determine if your business idea works well from home.

Ask yourself whether your business idea will work well from home. Some
businesses simply aren’t suited to be based from home. If you want to run a
dog boarding center but live in an apartment without a backyard, you might
want to consider a dog walking business instead.

### 8\. Set up an office.

If your business idea is well-suited for being run from home, it’s still
important you have a designated workspace. While a home office might not be
possible, consider setting aside a corner in your living room or putting a
desk in your bedroom for a space that inspires you and creates the conditions
for success.

Need a more professional space? If you conduct client-facing work requiring
you to be on video calls, no one wants to see your rumpled sheets in the
background. Check out local coworking spaces for memberships that earn you
access to conference rooms, desk space, and more.

### 9\. Get to work!

You’ve put in the hard work and I’ve got good news — it’s only going to get
harder. But most entrepreneurs will agree that the payoff of being your own
boss, making your own hours, and working on projects that you’re passionate
about will pay dividends for the rest of your life.

## Starting a Small Business: FAQ

### What are the types of small businesses?

The types of small business structures are sole proprietorships, partnerships, limited
liability companies (LLCs), and corporations.

### Which business type is best?

The best business type is a limited liability company (LLC). Operating as an
LLC means that your personal assets are separate from your business assets. If
your business goes bankrupt, your personal holdings won’t be affected. That
said, it’s also one of the costlier types, requiring a fee paid to the state.

The easiest business type to start is a sole proprietorship. The main downside
is that there’s no differentiation between you and your business.

### How do I create a business idea?

To create a business idea, determine your skill set, work preferences, startup
budget, and available resources. It’s important to strike the right balance
between what you can feasibly offer and what you can feasibly afford in the
short and long term.

We recommend starting with your skill set so that you can easily determine the
niche in which you can effectively compete. For instance, if you have ample
experience as a writer, you might consider starting a freelance writing
business. But if you know you’d prefer to work with clients face-to-face, you
might choose to start a ghostwriting business instead. That’s why it’s so
important to take your work preferences into account, as well.

After that, take a look at your budget and determine the type of business you
can start based on the resources at your disposal. For instance, you might not
be able to afford a physical office or location, so a location-based business
will likely not be a good fit. In that case, starting an online business is
your best option.

### What are some of the most successful small businesses?

Every small business has the potential to be successful and profitable,
provided it’s backed by a strong product-market
fit and a robust business
plan. These two
elements are essential. Maybe post-natal services are one of the most
successful small businesses to launch, but if you live in an area with
declining population or a large elderly population, then that small business
idea won’t yield a high return on investment.

Think carefully about the market where you’re launching your business, and
you’ll be more than likely to see lasting success.

### What are the top growing small businesses?

statistics

The top growing industries are healthcare support, technology, personal care,
food preparation, and community and social service. As such, launching a small
business in any of these fields is bound to yield a high return on investment,
but remember to take your target market into account.

Here are some small business ideas for each of those industries:

#### Healthcare Support

  * In-home care assistant
  * In-home elderly care provider
  * Psychological care provider
  * Pre-natal and post-natal support specialist

#### Technology

  * Freelance programmer or web developer
  * Freelance IT support specialist
  * Freelance cybersecurity expert

#### Personal Care

  * Hair stylist
  * Nail technician
  * Beautician

#### Food Preparation

  * Personal chef
  * Food truck owner
  * Food delivery

#### Community and Social Services

  * Non-profit owner
  * Education specialist
  * Nursery

## Brainstorm Your Next Small Business Venture

Selecting a small business idea to work on is a personal decision. Money is
important, but you’ll need more motivation than that to keep going. Bounce
ideas off your friends and family until you reach the perfect idea that works
for your schedule, fulfills your life’s passion, and makes financial sense.
Don’t be afraid to ask for help throughout this process — and remember to have
a little fun while you’re putting in the work.

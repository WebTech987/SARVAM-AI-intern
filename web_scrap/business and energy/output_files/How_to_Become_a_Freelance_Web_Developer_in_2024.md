## 1\. What is a freelance developer?

A freelance developer works with clients, businesses, or organizations on a
contract or project basis to make apps or websites, test them, and put them
online.

They’re usually self-employed and may be affiliated with one or more brands as
contractors. Their scope of work includes client and project management.

Some freelancers might have a set of skills, while others are highly
specialized. A freelancer, for example, could create an end-to-end mobile app
and deliver it to end users. Another might be specialized in testing
applications.

A freelance web developer builds websites and web applications. There are many
“types” of web developers, such as frontend and backend developers, full stack
developers, and Salesforce developers, to name but a few.

Freelance programmers also work under different terms and conditions. Some
charge hourly or daily rates; others charge on a project basis; and others run
agencies individually or as a team.

Because freelancers are self-employed, they’re responsible for filing their
own taxes and other aspects like drafting contracts, sending out invoices to
clients, following up on payments, looking for new clients, and keeping the
current ones happy.

Now that we know who a freelance coder is, let’s examine crucial factors to
determine whether this is a path you should take.

## 2\. Why you should consider freelance web development

If you’re already a developer, you’ve most likely been working for the same
company for years, or have been bouncing from job to job each year. What
started out fascinating quickly became mundane.

If you’re a tech junkie, you’ll be looking for a way to build a skillset that
allows you to work on your own terms.

#### So, you have the skills:

You’ve already trained in HTML **.**

Learned CSS.

You’re a dab hand at JavaScript.

Then it’s the perfect time to join the freelance programmer movement.

### Build your craft faster

Having a portfolio is an awesome way to showcase your skills. With freelance
projects, you can establish your developer profile.

Better still, working on freelance projects will push you to learn faster and
improve your web development skills. This is because you’ll need to learn some
things in order to solve problems in your project and deliver a complete
product to your clients.

Even when you cannot figure something out by yourself, you can ask for help
from tech communities, and your new best friend in 2024: generative AI.
Another reason freelance web development is so appetising these days is due to
the host of AI programming tools which have come online in 2023. Used
correctly, these tools allow all types of coders to maximise their efficiency,
building bigger and faster. This means that the kinds of projects that a one-
person freelancer can take on has increased, leading to a bigger portfolio and
more work.

If you suffer from impostor
syndrome, seeing yourself create solutions in the real world will help you
become more confident.

As you ship more projects and become better at your craft, you can eventually
get referrals and take on bigger projects.

### Freelancer benefits

Here are four major benefits when working freelance:

  1. **A** **better work-life balance:** You can have breakfast with your partner again, say “Goodbye” to your commute, spend more time with your family, or travel—freelancing can open the door to a world of opportunities.
  2. **Being your own boss:** Being a freelance web developer means you can work all morning or all night for that matter. There’s no flatter hierarchy that just one employee—you.
  3. **Freedom to choose your working hours / clients / rate of pay:** Say a polite “No thank you” to that miserable client and to his criminally low budget as well.
  4. **The chance to work on more interesting projects:** There’s no more monotony, each month bringing a variety of work, clients and opportunities according to which projects you choose.

### The advantages of being your own boss

As a freelance web developer, you put yourself in a high value position.
However, getting started can be
tough. As a freelancer, you have to be able to run your own business,
and self discipline requires hard work. You have to be strict with yourself.

If you need the motivation, here are 3 major pros about being a freelance web
developer:

 **First:** There's lots of demand.

Your skills are highly sought-after in every industry. There are currently
over **15,000** web developer
jobs in the United States
alone!

 **Second:** There is a huge shortage of web
developers worldwide.
In 2020, an estimated **1 million software developer** roles went unfilled in
the tech industry.

 **Third:** Contract salaries are frequently high. According to job site
Glassdoor, the average freelance web developer salary
in the US is $79,806= awesome!!

Now that you’re convinced the life of a freelance web developer is for you,
it’s time for us to walk you through the step-by-step process.

## 3\. How to become a freelance web developer in 6 steps

At this point, you’re probably really excited about becoming a freelance web
developer. So, naturally, your next question might be how to get started.

### Step One: Find your niche

Want to stand out from the crowd?

Firstly you’ll need to find a web development
course and upgrade your skills. Then, find yourself a niche and focus your
skills.  
While it’s great to be a programmer that can do a bit of everything, your
value will be higher as an expert in just a few areas.

> “Becoming known as the solution to a particular set of problems is crucial
> to your freelance career, so you need to be willing to differentiate and
> then lock it in.” – **Ted Johnson, freelance web developer**

You don’t ever just want to be “that developer I know” but rather “an expert
developer for [insert problem here]”.

It’ll be much easier to advertise your skills and make a name for yourself if
you can say you’re the best in a particular, sought-after area, or the only
one who can do it.

It’s important to hone your skills and stay on top of current trends. The
world of web development is vast. There are multiple programming
languages to choose from including
Ruby, Python, and JavaScript, plenty of frameworks
React,
Node, and Vue, and even platforms WordPress, Shopify, Salesforce, and
Directus.

### Step Two: Build, build, build

You’ve found your niche. Congratulations! Now it’s time to get building.

The best place to start is your portfolio
website, the one website you will update, edit and continually develop for
your entire career.

Your portfolio is a way of displaying your skills and having an easy reference
for potential clients.

If in doubt, remember: your goal is to be easy to find, easy to remember, and
good to know.

That's exactly what CareerFoundry graduate Aron Eidelman did, by filling his
software engineer portfolio with impressive projects such as his "Makeup and
Hair by Adelina" site, built in JavaScript and styled with HTML and CSS.

So, once you’ve published your CV, previewed samples of your past work and
added a contact form—what should you do now?

 **Build your ideas** , they are what make you, you! Once you’ve built your
portfolio, next you’ll need things to put in it. This is an opportunity to
boost your personal brand by:

  * **Practising your niche skill**
  * **Building your own ideas**
  * **Exhibiting your technical chops**

Your portfolio is your shop window, so make sure that it, and its contents,
represent your very best work.

And if you want help making it better, help others! Contributing to open-
source projects can further boost your credibility as a programmer.

Better still, the source code is accessible to everyone to tweak and
contribute. You can find some open-source projects on
GitHub
and contribute to improving software or adding a use case!

Keep a blog that explains your process, ask and answer questions on social
media, and build, build, build every day.

### Step Three: Create your personal brand

It’s all about the hustle! Getting your name out there as an expert in the
field can be tough, **but if you want the freelance lifestyle, you’ll have to
hustle for it.**

The good news is that there are so many opportunities for professionals to get
known without spending a penny.

Your personal brand transcends your portfolio. It's how people perceive you.
As a freelance web developer you should strive to be seen as reputable within
the tech and business communities.

That means in addition to delivering sublime projects, you need to be
professional in how you deal with your clients and end users.

You also need to have a strong online presence. This means being present where
other developers and potential clients are.

 **It’s crucial that you talk to people. Online and off.**

Always keep in mind that **you’ll have to talk to a lot of people to find and
land clients** , so get used to it!

Professional freelancer Rebecca Shapiro has this advice:

>  ** _“Make sure that you seek freelancers outside of your industry, as well.
> Be as far-reaching as possible. Go into building these relationships with an
> attitude of giving instead of getting and you’ll find you’ve easily built a
> reciprocal referral network.”_**

Make yourself visible by keeping your goals simple. Getting Google to find you
if you have a normal name can be tough.

Focus on attaching your name across your portfolio, social profiles and
content to the terminology of your niche skill.

As usual, the internet is an extremely valuable resource. There are some great
websites for online marketing that you’ll already be familiar with, but they
can be great for different reasons:

  * **X formerly Twitter** — Create a following by tweeting about current news in **your niche**. Great for networking and having conversations with people in your field from around the world.
  * **Quora** — Great for answering questions from people interested in your niche. Fosters relationships with other professionals, while getting your name out there in Web Development circles.
  * **Dev.to** - this is a publishing platform for programmers. You can write tutorials and share them with other coders, for example. You can also find work via job listings, projects to contribute to, or events to attend.
  * **Discord** — you can interact with developers from all over the world via Discord “servers”, which are similar to channels. Different servers connect different programmers together. Servers can be programming language-based, for example, a Python Discord channel. A lot of software companies also use Discord as a way to stay connected with their users.
  * **Slack** — just like Discord, Slack connects coders and companies. Slack is also used for internal communication and collaboration by companies.   
As a freelancer, you can use Slack for collaboration and communication with
your clients. If you’re affiliated with a specific company on a longer-term
contract, they might create a Slack channel for you for collaboration
purposes.

  * **Stack Overflow** — this is the biggest question-and-answer forum for programmers. As you gain more experience, you can help out other coders by answering questions.
  * **YouTube** — Create online tutorials and upload them. Give them easy-to-Google titles like: “How to become a Freelance Web Developer….” make them personal and funny; **the more watchable they are, the more people will come back to you**.
  * **GitHub** — this is a must-have as a developer. It is part of your oeuvre. GitHub allows you to back up your code, and collaborate with others. You can also contribute to other projects. There are other options like Gitlab and Bitbucket.

These are just some platforms to get you started. Other tools you can look up
include tooling around project management like
Jira and
Trello, documentation tools like
Confluence and
Gitbook, and of course
LinkedIn to show that you’re a real professional.

### Step Four: Get organized

Becoming a freelance web developer is not just about knowing how to
code.

It’s about being a project
manager, a salesperson and Head of Customer Care—all at the same
time.

You might not have had much experience in these areas but they are just as
crucial to the success of your freelancing career.

This means you need to get organized—and we all need help with that!

#### Time and project management tools

Use these time and project management tools to make life easier:

  * **Quoteroller** is a practical, time-saving way to create and send professional proposals to clients in a matter of minutes. You can chart your proposal’s performance and even see when the client has opened it.
  * **Toggl** and **Timely** are great ways to track projects and see how much time you are spending on each one.
  * **Asana** is an excellent project management system, especially if you are working with others and need to delegate tasks or collaborate.
  * **Google** has an infinite range of calendars and management apps.
  * **BillingsPro** for project management and invoicing.
  * **FreshBooks** organize your projects, invoicing and expenses all with one app.
  * **HubStaff** is an Asana integration that will help you to track your time and productivity, and bill clients accordingly.

In addition, **always have a contract in writing**. Some companies will have
you sign one when you begin working with them. Individual clients usually
don’t have contracts. This Github repo has some contract
templates you can use.

Josh Boyd, freelancer and **writer for Crunch** ,
has this advice:

### Step Five. Build up your experience, project by project

Now that you’ve got that new, in-demand skill under your belt and a slick
website, **it’s time to do some real projects to show potential clients**.

Some popular beginner-friendly freelance web developer sites include
Upwork,
Truelancer, and
Freelancer.com.

As you become more experienced, you could sign up on sites like
Turing, arc.dev,
Fiverr Pro, and
Toptal, which connect top-tier developers to
companies to work remotely for companies around the world.

Do this while you’re still in your full-time job to get a feel of the amount
of time you’ll need and what you can realistically start to earn per project.

While you’re still finding your feet, experience is what counts. You are still
very much in the learning process here: Learning how to be a business person
and a freelancer.

Use this step as a chance to learn how to handle clients, to find out what
they will expect from you.

 **Find your feet by helping someone out!**

Doing projects for local charities, schools or small businesses who simply
can’t afford to pay a web developer’s rate helps you and them.

By doing this, you are building up your portfolio and getting great references
for your CV: crucially, you’ll learn how to deal with people.

### Step Six: Be brave

This is my final and most important piece of advice:

 **When you start out, you’re not going to be an expert in your field.**

You may take on projects that you aren’t sure how you’re going to finish. If
that’s the case, if you’re not 100% confident of how you’re going to complete
a project— **give your client a realistic idea of when they can expect that
work back.** If you tell them it’s going to take longer than they expect, it’s
better you tell them that now than when the deadline has passed.

Help is out there!

Our reliable friend Google can help you with almost every kind of programming
query you have, as well as websites like StackOverflow.

The tech communities that you’re part of should also be another option for you
to get all the help you need with your project.

Finding a mentor is a good strategy too, especially someone who has been a
freelancer for a while. They’ll advise you on potential pitfalls and provide
you with a road map for your freelance career.

 **Don’t let lack of confidence stop you from taking on these bigger
projects**. It’s how you’ll develop as a freelancer and how you’ll learn your
trade.

Anything is possible. You’re your own boss now.
